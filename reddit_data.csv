Price of gold went to $1633 matching the incremental fed rate hike till October 22.

Fed hike kept increasing till 5% June 2023, but gold started increasing since 10/22 as well!

Can someone explain why? Should higher fed rate means stronger dollar so gold/USD should go down? Why the hike back from$1600 to $1920 now even the FED rate was up from 2.5% to 5% ?

I understand inflation is at 4% but now with the 5% Fed rate real interest is %1, right? So why is gold not down? Is there other factors ? Is it a question of time ?

t3_14o0uk1|1688233000.0|investing|Fed Working Paper - 40% of real corporate profit growth after 1989 was fueled by a decline of interest rates and corporate tax cuts.|"Full PDF: https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2023041pap.pdf

Author (Michael Smolyansky, Principal Economist of the Federal Reserve) says in the abstract:

&gt; I show that the decline in interest rates and corporate tax rates over the past three decades accounts
for the majority of the period’s exceptional stock market performance. Lower interest expenses
and corporate tax rates mechanically explain over 40 percent of the real growth in corporate profits
from 1989 to 2019. In addition, the decline in risk-free rates alone accounts for all of the expansion
in price-to-earnings multiples. I argue, however, that the boost to profits and valuations from ever declining interest and corporate tax rates is unlikely to continue, indicating significantly lower
profit growth and stock returns in the future. 

From Fig 1, interest and tax went from 50% of EBIT to maybe 25% today.

He concludes that EBIT is now constrained to increase at the economic growth rate of &lt;2% a year.     And that the equity risk premium was 7.2% rather than 3.6% between 1962 and 1989.    He contradicts Greenwald et al (2022), saying that it wasn't reallocation of profits from labor to capital that drove the high corporate profits growth.    And he says that his conclusions is pessimistic, because he doesn't take into account the feedback effect of  low taxes and interest on EBIT, just their fraction of it.   

Smolyansky claims (page 16) that 

&gt; an expansion in P/E multiples accounted for 33 percent of stock price growth for S&amp;P 500 nonfinancial firms ... that the decline in risk-free rates from 1989 to 2019 can explain the entirety of the expansion in P/E multiples.

In Table 1, it's a bit depressing that the 1962-1989 era was better in fundamentals like sales growth and GDP growth but worse for stock market performance, including real dividend growth and net income growth.    So a return to reality today would be anchored in worse fundamentals.

To conclude:

&gt; In the future, the real longer run growth rate of both stock prices and corporate earnings is
therefore unlikely to exceed 2 percent per year. Given that this represents an optimistic scenario,
the risks to this forecast, if anything, are to the downside. 

tl;dr - ouch.   And he's not even talking about cutting rates and raising taxes, just about keeping them flat.

If I naively assume that real returns, growth plus payouts, are 1/PE in the absence of an external driver (rate and tax cuts), then returns should be 1/25=4%; given around 2% dividends, then 1/PE-Dividends could be the 2% he's talking about.  But I'm not sure if I'm doing this right.

If this is all true, does it mean that existing mature companies that pay significant dividends are a better bet than investing in illusory growth?      Or at least, any solid company with a low PE is better, because 1/PE is all you'll get for a long time?     Maybe, because non-value companies are priced on the basis of (falsely) anticipated future growth.   But I suspect that if Smolyansky is right, there won't be any real refuges."|0.96|245.0|0.0|245.0

I would be using this account to save up for a down payment on a multi-family house, but if it's just better to save in my checking account than have to pay the taxes on that interest I'll just take that extra $100/month and put it into my robinhood investment account instead.

I will soonly have a certain amount of money to invest. At first I was thinking to only invest in ETFs like cw8 for example, (very) long term only.

  
But recently I started to get a bit more ambitious… or greedy ? I know that on a 20-30 years span, with big ETF like cw8 I can reach yearly 5% on average, but I like the “science” around stocks, investment and so on, so I think it’s a good deal to give a bit of my time if I can reach more than 5%... and I’ll feel more in control too since I’d choose myself the stocks to pick, when to buy when to sell and so on…

  
So if I understood right I’d be more in a “position trading” strategy, since I'm still thinking long term. The way I imagine it is like, I cautiously pick a stock to buy, waiting for roughly 1 or 2 years, selling it and take profit. Ideal case I know. I was even considering to pay a premium subscription on websites like seekingalpha to get the best stocks recommandations but I’ve read on reddit that even with that kind of “high level content” this is to take with great caution.  

  
So, could you recommend me some kind of good websites, apps, or whatever to choose the right stocks ? I mean I don’t aim to become a billionaire, I wonder how greedy my text sounds, but “position trading” is a thing right ?

  
Thanks in advance for your answers !

t3_14mhv7y|1688076000.0|investing|How Well-Prepared Are U.S. Banks for the 'Perfect Storm'?|"“The US banking system remains strong and resilient,” Vice Chair for Supervision Michael S. Barr [declared](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20230628a.htm) following the receipt of stress test results for the nation's largest banks. Indeed, it's promising news. This month I've already examined some of the challenges faced by the banking sector, yet in the face of major stressors including a 10% unemployment rate and a steep drop in residential and commercial property values, the system is holding up. The test projected combined losses for the top 23 banks would be $541 billion, with Tier 1 declining between 2.3 and 10.1% percentage points.

Already we've seen an initial regulatory response, and as a result, banks now have clarity on their necessary capital reserves. More regulatory developments are on the horizon, as on the heels of the stress test, regulators will disclose new capital requirements under the Basel III Endgame. Back in early June, there were rumors that the Fed might raise capital requirements for large banks by 20% and reduce the asset threshold from 250 billion to 100 billion, so we’ll finally get to see what happens on that front.

The Fed also plans to overhaul its banking supervision rules. Powell explained this push by stating that banks tend overlook additional risks, citing as evidence the SVB collapse. He argued that the bank fell not due to credit risks, but as a consequence of ignoring interest rate risks and flaws in their business model.

In any event, it's clear that large banks will weather the storm - they're simply too big to fail. Recent stress tests, however, indicate that many might need to delay shareholder payouts, or at least to trim them down to size. In the past, when the Fed conducted stress tests, all major banks would publicize their shareholder return plans. This year is different, as the stakes are higher and more clarity is needed on the new policies. Still, Wall Street responded positively today with a rise in banking stocks.

What does this mean for regional banks?

Here the situation gets trickier. Most regional banks provide loans to real estate and retail sectors. As rates climb, loan volumes are gradually decreasing, threatening income and necessitating a decrease in deposits. Mortgage loans are also in decline. However, we can at least sleep soundly about residential real estate, as recent stats paint a relatively positive picture.

Commercial real estate could still pose a problem though. With remote work due to COVID-19 becoming the norm, office spaces sit unused—not a great situation for landlords, nor for the banks that financed their investments. According to Green Street, average office costs have decreased by 27%. It's worth noting that by 2025, about $1.5 trillion of commercial real estate debt is due for repayment, and several regional banks are already actively cutting back on commercial real estate investments and are instead offloading assets.

Moreover, loan delinquencies are rising. In May, over 4% of securitized commercial real estate loans were more than 30 days overdue, the highest mark since 2018.

I'm not insinuating anything, but these facts do raise some eyebrows.

In conclusion, yes, the U.S. banking system is strong and prepared for a storm. The proverbial black swans have turned grey, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. In order to avoid a crisis, further proactive measures will need to be taken, and it seems that regulators are doing just that."|0.47|0.0|0.0|0.0

t3_14m93i9|1688055205.0|investing|Warren Buffett built a $107 billion net worth through investing. Every year since 1965 he’s written an annual letter showing us how he did it.|"**Here are 10 investing lessons from Warren Buffett:**

**1. What you own**  
What and how you invest matters.  
Buffett focuses on businesses with great management and economic advantages.  
The key word is business.  
Buffett isn’t a stock picker.  
He calls himself a business picker.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Diversification**  
Just because you’re diversified doesn’t mean you have less risk.  
And just because you have a concentrated position doesn’t mean you have more risk.  
Concentrating on a few stocks can decrease your risk if it means you’ll pay more attention to the business.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Market pricing**  
Buffett says a stock price shouldn’t determine whether you buy or sell.  
In the short term, people vote with their dollars on which stocks will do well.  
In the long term, stocks with the most value tend to do well.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Be greedy when others are fearful**  
When money is cheap, hold on to it.  
When money is expensive, invest it.  
Every so often doom and gloom will hit the stock market.  
This is your chance to run towards it with wads of cash.  
Instead of running away with pennies on the dollar.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Buy businesses that reinvest in themselves**  
If it’s a great company, with great management, and great profits…  
Why wouldn’t they reinvest in themselves?  
This creates an element of compound interest.  
Except instead of your returns compounding, it’s business operations.

&amp;#x200B;

**6. Prioritize moat**  
If a business model produces high profits, there will be competition.  
Businesses that thrive like this have one thing in common:  
A moat.  
A moat doesn’t only keep them profitable, but it keeps them in competition long term.  
This is crucial for investors.

&amp;#x200B;

**7. Buy boring businesses**  
Especially if they sell products/services people need.  
Boring businesses provide stability and longevity to your portfolio.  
This allows you to make money for longer periods of time.

&amp;#x200B;

**8. Invest like a sloth**  
“For investors as a whole, returns decrease as motions increase.”  
Most investors would make more money if they bought and held instead of buying and trading.  
This applies to rebalancing too.  
Here’s what I mean…

&amp;#x200B;

**9. Rebalancing your portfolio**  
Most people trim a position once it gets large.  
Buffett does the opposite.  
Selling positions that have become too big is the same as the bulls trading Michael Jordan because he’s become too good.  
Don’t sell your winners.  
Let them run.

&amp;#x200B;

**10. Time and business**  
Time is a friend of great businesses but an enemy of the mediocre.  
Just because a company does well short term doesn’t mean it’s sustainable.  
“When the tide goes out, you’ll see who’s been swimming naked.”  
This isn't just investors.  
It's businesses too."|0.85|1047.0|0.0|1047.0

The portion in question states:

""Wealthy investors are still in wealth preservation mode,” said CNBC Wealth editor Robert Frank in a recent interview dissecting Capgemini’s report. More than two-thirds of investors surveyed said preserving their capital was a top priority right now.  
  
Rampant inflation and rising interest rates have made stocks less attractive. Meanwhile, cash and cash equivalents can generate better-than-anticipated returns. A two-year U.S. government treasury bond offers a yield of 4.59%. That’s the highest interest rates have been on risk-free investments since 2007.  
  
**By comparison, the S&amp;P 500 currently offers an earnings yield (inverted price-to-earnings ratio) of 4%**.""

I had never heard of this metric, and I can't understand why it is important. I thought that usually you reference the S&amp;P 500's YTD total return when assessing the attractiveness of an S&amp;P tracking instrument.

Was hoping to learn why my reasoning is wrong, as well as instances that you'd care about the earnings yield vs the total return."|0.72|9.0|0.0|9.0

Lately been weighin on different t-bill ladder strategies. The goal is to employ my capital in a safe heaven and wait out this current ridiculous pump on a thin air – then do some decent shopping in 24’.   
I have to stay as flexible/liquid as possible since: a) the further down the line, the more likely are good deals to appear on the market; b) I’m in the Eurozone so will flip EUR once USD pumps considerably during the potential crash; c) short-term yields likely to grow further to 6-8% since no cuts (provided there’s no black swan) till 24’   
Correct me if I’m wrong but very short mat. bills (2 week-2 month) seem to cater much better for these needs as opposed to longer ones? Fees are negligible ($5 for a trade on IB), so no problem rolling those over even weekly. They keep you liquid at virtually all times. Even in the event of a circuit breaker (and a subsequent rate cut/yield fall), chances are you’ll sell 2M above water way easier than 6M way before maturity, right? And then will be able to lock-in still high yield for longer once it’s already started declining.   
On the other hand, am I right to assume I'll usually be able to sell even longer mat. bills for a profit way before maturity? Eg, I buy 6M, the yields keep on rising moderately and I want to sell in 1-2 months (to lock in higher yields or invest elsewhere). Is it likely I’ll I be above water by then or is it likely a moderate yield growth will have pushed my bills into a negative territory?

Seeing some recent rave reviews about TSLA, ADBE, and FDX lately. Talking about the charging method Tesla uses becoming the standard in North America and being adopted by SAE, Adobe's investments in generative AI, and Fedex being able to pick up some slack if UPS workers go on strike, as well as some other investments and innovations they've been making.

But the problem is, I just don't see them valued at good prices. 

FDX is trading at almost 2.5x book and 21x earnings

ADBE is trading at 15x book, almost 47x earnings, and 12x revenue per share

TSLA is trading at almost 17x book, almost 74x earnings, and over 9x revenue per share.

From a valuation standpoint (P/B, P/E, and P/S), those numbers are completely unjustifiable when considering buying.

So is there something I'm missing? Something I'm failing to consider? It seems like in the case of TSLA and ADBE their tech advancements could be a competitive advantage.

We also refinanced during Covid for a 2.75% interest rate. It’s just a great set-up. We are very interested in keeping this house and renting it out because of those facts.

We have about $70K in liquid cash sitting in a 4.3% high yield savings account with the idea to save up for a down payment on a new house in the next 2 years. I just don’t know if I’m losing value not having this cash in the stock market already. 

I feel like I haven’t and don’t put enough money away in retirement as i need to. I’m maxing out a Roth and also have $500/m going into a brokerage retirement account. Just over $1,000/month in total. 

What’s the wisest decision here? Keep the home and hopefully save up enough for a down payment? Or just put the money into retirement/investments for the long haul? I know selling our current home will easily give us enough $ for the next house down payment. I just don’t know."|0.74|62.0|0.0|62.0

The paperwork I was given says that I can contribute a max of $22.5k to both of these each year. I already have a 401(k) from my primary employer and a backdoor Roth IRA, both of which I'm maxing out. Am I able to max out annual contributions to both of these along with my 401(k) , or am I limited to one or the other? There's also a DC Plan that I'm forced to contribute to pre-tax in lieu of social security.

This is likely a temporary gig. When it's done, am I able to roll all of these over into my 401(k) or Roth IRA? If so, would it affect the annual maximum contribution limit for either? I'm guessing no on the latter question but wanted to make sure there's nothing I'm overlooking. All of this is being done through Fidelity which is also where I have my other retirement accounts.

The amount of money I'm making from this gig is probably not enough for any of this to be a serious concern, but I'd also like to learn for my own education, or just in case it turns into a bigger or longer term role.

However, I am having a tough time discerning which is the better investment: something like VTI (which is what my most of my Roth IRA is) or my employers default fund (MUTF: MLACX).

Over the last 5 years (according to Google):

* VTI has **gained** 54%
* MUTF: MLACX has **lost** 39%

However, when I [view MUTF: MLACX on Fidelity](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/56062X658), it shows that it has performed about the same as S&amp;P (which performs about the same as VTI). It also indicates that its 5 year return is 10% - a lot different than what Google shows (minus 39%).

Therefore, it is unclear if this fund is truly on par with VTI or vastly worse. 

Just hoping someone who understands this better could provide some clarity here. I figure others may also be in my situation and could benefit from understanding the options we have with 401ks and the nuances of each option. Thanks!"|0.74|14.0|0.0|14.0

Concentrix CNXC is a traditional CX call center service that has many clients like Apple etc. **Three of the most important factors for analyzing stocks is History, Competitors, and Outlook -- so I will be trying to put my take on it and make it short as possible.**

**Competitors:**

**History:**

The biggest competitor to Concentrix is Teleperformance. So comparing the history of Teleperformance should tell you what the normal range of valuation should be for Concentrix.

|Average|2.22|2.22|2.22|2.22|2.22|

**Outlook:**

Concentrix is acquiring Webhelp (private) and becoming the biggest CX provider. They are neck in neck with Teleperformance who acquired Majorel for 1.5 times sales to Enterprise Value - means they all feel prices are low enough for consolidation in the industry.

Looking at the first table it looks like Concentrix is undervalued by 40% on already depressed numbers of EV/Revenue as average EV/Revenue for Teleperformance has been more like 2 historically. So prices will be expected to reach $120 on just 1 times EV/Revenue.

But lets say if we give it a more reasonable number of 1.5-2 EV/Revenue then stock price will be expected to reach $160."|0.4|0.0|0.0|0.0

They have acquired a few years back Wizards of the Coast (WOTC) , the company who does Dungeon and Dragon, Warhammer and most importantly, Magic the Gathering. 
While WOTC represents around 23% of the revenues of the group, it represents 70% of the profit. 

They have just released a new edition of Magic the Gathering playing cards in partnership with The Lord of the Rings. They were smart enough to add in the set a unique card ""the one ring"" with a monstruous value as some people are willing to pay 2mio for that card when found. By consequences, people are paying huge sums to try to find this card and the collector cards are nowhere to be found. Called a few gaming shops and was informed that they won't be able to get these cards back. Also saw a lot of new people starting to play magic because of this. 


I expect them to exceptionally crush their revenues based on this hype and for this segment to keep growing. Also expect a drop of revenues post this edition.

My only goal was to match the performance of my 401k which did extremely well for the decade prior.

I (23F) recently came into a good bit of money (290K). Before this happened, I would consider myself to be very aware of money, and minimally engaged with investing and the market. Before this lump some I have 25K in the bank that I pay someone to invest for me, and it loosely follows the NASDAQ (as I’m told). With this money, some has already been allocated. 

100K- I bought a house. This number includes my down payment and renovations and the addition of an ADU I will be living in. I will be renting out the main house and living rent free or almost rent free. This house is in an up and coming area, and an ADU is a very secure value adding renovation. 

75K- put into my investing account that already has money in it investing in long term stocks 

100K- in a money market account for even lower risk lower gain. This is a temporary measure until I have secured tenants and cash flow in my house. I just didn’t want to risk a drop in the next year when I may need it emergently. This money is where my main question comes in 

15K- for funzies

My questions are as follows: what do y’all think of my breakdown, and what is something a little higher risk higher reward I should look into for my 100K once I establish cash flow from the house. I’m young, this money fell into my lap, while I want to be smart and set myself up for success I also think this is the time to take some leaps of faith. 

Please be kind, I know I’m not as educated as many people here on the stock market but I’m doing my best and willing to learn.

We have no debt (other than mortgage), paid off cars, and between all of our investments, have a net worth of about 1.2 million currently. 

We plan on selling our house (300k equity now), liquidating a lot of our investments, and building roughly a 7-800k home on our 5 acres.

I'm invested exclusivly into the US stock market but my native currency is the CHF.

I want to hedge my exposure to the USD vs the CHF via the CME Micro USD/CHF (M6S) futures with a notional value of 10'000 USD.

My broker is IBRK and they will happily let me trade this product. Now I'm familiar with the mechanics of futures and IBRK wants me to put up about 1000$ in margin per short future.

We can assume I have 10'000 USD in US Stocks/ETFs and I sell one USD/CHF Micro Future short with 2000$ in cash in my account.

Would some of you shed some light on the following questions?

&amp;#x200B;

1. Have I now fixed my exchange rate to the USD and am now immune to the fluctuations of the USD vs the CHF?
2. Can I always roll the contract to the following front month only adding the profit/loss of the previous expiration?
3. The contract M6S seems to be rather illiquid. What are the typical spreads on such contracts?
4. What risk am I adding to my portfolio? Technicly speaking I have 10'000 USD in the form of equities but they can decline vs. the CHF for other reasons than the USDCHF exchange rate and I'm still on the hook for that futures contract. What are the added risks as a retail investor by using such rather complex (and often dangerous) instruments for hedging in this case?
5. Should I even bother?

3 Low-Priced REITs Making Big Moves
Mentioned:	BDN CIO DHC HPP UNIT
Several low-priced real estate investment trusts (REITs) made huge moves higher this week, and many are in the office or healthcare subsectors.

Investors know that low-priced stocks can be volatile, and it's as easy to lose as it is to gain a lot in the short term. These stocks are not for conservative investors or for people on a fixed income who cannot afford to take large risks with their capital.

But abrupt new moves in a low-priced stock often portend even more future gains to come. If an investor is patient and perhaps waits for a price pullback off a spike, it is possible to do quite well on these trades.

Take a look at three low-priced REITs that have blasted higher on increasing volume this week.

Don't miss: The Company That Built Elon Musk's Tiny Home Is Partnering With This REIT To Solve The Affordable Housing Crisis And Provide A Unique Investment Opportunity

Diversified Healthcare Trust (NASDAQ: DHC) is a Newton, Massachusetts-based healthcare REIT that owns 376 healthcare-related properties of approximately $7.1 billion across 36 states and Washington, D.C. In addition to over 100 life science and medical offices, Diversified Healthcare Trust also has 27,389 senior living community units in its portfolio.

In April, Office Properties Income Trust (NASDAQ: OPI) announced it was acquiring Diversified Healthcare Trust in an all-share transaction. It seemed like a done deal because in May, Office Properties Income Trust began to implement the financing needed to complete the transaction.

On June 2, Diversified Healthcare Director Adam D. Portnoy purchased a total of 5,566,644 shares at an average price of $1.77 per share, for a total of $9.81 million.

However, on June 5, investment adviser firm Flat Footed LLC, a top shareholder with about 8% of Diversified Healthcare Trust, reiterated its intent to vote against the proposed merger. Flat Footed sent a letter to the Diversified Healthcare board asking for clarification of details of the merger â specifically why the board is willing to let Diversified Healthcare go for $1.13 per share after rejecting an all-cash $4 per share bid in 2022. The letter also asked why Portnoy was purchasing Diversified Healthcare stock at $1.77, well above the merger price.

Diversified Healthcare shares rose quickly after this was announced and are up 37.28% over the past three days. Its most recent closing price was $2.32.

Uniti Group Inc. (NASDAQ: UNIT) is a Little Rock, Arkansas-based specialty REIT that acquires and constructs mission-critical communications infrastructure in the form of fiber optics, copper and coaxial broadband networks.

Uniti Group owns and operates 137,000 fiber route miles covering 275,000 commercial buildings, with most of its network in the Eastern and Midwestern portions of the U.S. It's one of the 10 largest fiber providers in the U.S. today, and its fiber optic leasing generates about 70% of its total revenue.

Analysts have been tepid on Uniti Group recently. Morgan Stanley analyst Simon Flannery maintained an Underweight rating on Uniti Group on June 1, while lowering the price target from $7 to $6. On May 30, RBC Capital Markets analyst Bora Lee maintained a Sector Perform rating on Uniti Group but lowered the price target from $7 to $5.

But over three days this week, and without any news, Uniti Group has risen 11.86%. On Tuesday, it was 6.3% higher in the premarket and finished up 4.4% for the day. Its most recent closing price was $4.34.

Unity Group President and CEO Kenny Gunderman purchased 225,000 shares of Uniti Group at an average price of $4.37 in the first week of March, amounting to $983,250.

Perhaps investors are feeling more confident that the $0.15 per share quarterly dividend, or $0.60 annual per share that yields 13.82%, will remain intact. The next ex-dividend date is June 15.

City Office REIT Inc. (NYSE: CIO) is a Dallas-based office REIT that owns 58 buildings totaling 6 million square feet. The REIT is focused on the Sun Belt region, West Coast and select areas in Florida.

On May 30, RBC Capital analyst Michael Carroll maintained a Sector Perform rating on City Office REIT but was more negative in lowering the price target from $10 to $7.

Nevertheless, City Office REIT is one of several office REITs that have seen huge price increases this week in a subsector that has had very little love from Wall Street for a long time. City Office REIT is up 9.7% this week.

Other low-priced office REITs picking up big gains this week are Brandywine Realty Trust (NYSE: BDN), up 10.71%, and Hudson Pacific Properties Inc. (NYSE: HPP), up 9.66% in three days. Office stocks were crushed between February and the end of May but have shown recent resiliency.

This is a huge opportunity for residential construction in California. The problem is, historically zoning laws have radically limited construction.

That’s changing, however. There have been a series of technical changes to the law, loosening zoning and speeding up permitting in various circumstances. Unfortunately, most of these laws have been rather small or under the radar, not immediately making a big difference.

That’s about  to change. [AB 2011](http://cayimby.org/ab-2011/) is coming into effect soon, which will legalize dense residential development on basically every commercially zoned lot in the state. City after city that is filled with strip malls, historically illegal for residential construction, will now automatically be approved for the cheapest per-unit style of construction (mid rise buildings 5-7 stories tall), with ministerial approval, subject only to inclusionary zoning requirements. Millions of units will be legalized overnight.

This is a big investment opportunity—but only for construction firms, not for landlords. Real estate owners on CA will be hurt, while developers will be helped.

For some reason, probably my initial stupidity in picking funds initially and subsequent neglect, I am now extremely light on large cap US exposure.  I have no problem at all redirecting future contributions and DCAing stronger into large cap US, but I'm not sure what to do about the current portfolio imbalance. 

 I'd like to sell out of some of my disproportionately overgrown small cap, mid cap, and foreign funds and buy into more large cap but with prices being as high as they are, I'm not completely comfortable doing it all at one time since I'm 55 and will only work another 7 to 10 years. So yes, I guess I'm timing the market, but out of caution not immediate return-seeking."|0.83|55.0|0.0|55.0
t3_14ilibf|1687697422.0|investing|Why is it so hard to invest in specific foreign countries?|"(Please note that while I have been investing for a while, it has been mostly according to standard strategy/buying broad-market index funds and planning to hold until retirement. Thus I'm not particularly well versed in terminology, concepts etc, so forgive me if any common misconceptions or novice-level misunderstandings are to blame for my confusion here)  

If I want to make a bet that the US economy will continue to grow from now until my investment horizon (and that this will be generally priced accurately by the market) I can choose from a dozen different index funds that track the US economy in various ways. If I want to make a similar bet that the world economy will continue to grow, there are plenty of options that do something similar but for the international economy.

However, say I want to make a bet that a specific foreign country's economy will grow from now until my investment horizon. Say, for example, Botswana. In theory, assuming that the stock performance of companies from a given country is tied to the growth of that country's economy, over a long enough period during which the Botswanan economy grows faster than the US economy an investment into a hypothetical ETF that tracked the Botswanan economy could have a higher yield than a US broad-market index fund.

So, say I want to make a bet on Botswana's growth. Why does it seem so hard to do this? For starters, I've done a little research, and it doesn't even seem like there *are* any ETFs that attempt to be based on the Botswanan economy at all, let alone any that attempt to track the Botswanan stock market specifically. On etfdb.com, only five ETFs which are based around exposure to African economies are listed at all! Two are South African economy index funds, one's an Egyptian economy index fund, one's a Nigerian economy index fund, and one's a general African economy ETF.

There are 36 companies listed on the Botswanan Stock Exchange. Is it just the case that this isn't a sufficient number of companies for there to exist an ETF that attempts to track the Botswanan economy by investing in Botswanan publicly-traded companies? 

The question as to why the economies of so many nations seem to be unnecessarily difficult to access as a US retail investor isn't the entire scope of my problem, either. As mentioned, some other specific foreign national economies are tracked by ETFs. However, it doesn't seem like these funds really... do what they're supposed to, if that makes sense. For example, here is my back of the napkin math: Over the last ten years or so, the US GDP has grown by a factor of about 1.6, from about 16 trillion dollars to about 26 trillion. Over the same time period, the price of SPY has grown by a factor of 2.7. Now, compare the ratio between US GDP growth:SPY yield to the ratio between Indian GDP growth:INDA yield over the same time period (INDA, which is MSCI's India ETF, being by far the largest Indian-economy-tracking ETF). Over the last ten years, the Indian GDP has grown by about a factor of 2, from 1.85 trillion dollars to 3.7 trillion dollars. However, the price of INDA has only grown by a factor of about 1.7 over this time period. Despite the Indian economy growing more rapidly than the American economy, ETFs that track the Indian economy performed vastly worse than ETFs that track the American economy - and not only that, but ETFs that track the Indian economy perform worse than the Indian economy, itself. 

A similar pattern seems to hold true for plenty of other foreign countries, even those with very optimistic economic futures like India's: whereas the value of US stock market index funds grow at a rate higher than the growth rate of the national economy, the value of ETFs tracking the economies of foreign nations grow at a rate much slower than the the growth rate of those countries' economies... if they even grow at all! As another example, the economy of the Philippines has done great over the last 10 years, growing by a factor of about 1.5. They have had a yearly growth rate of about 6 percent over the last few years, which the IMF expects to continue into 2024. Despite this, the iShares MSCI Philippines ETF, EHPE, has only steadily *lost* value over the same time period of the last ten years, depreciating by a factor of 0.7! 

I could understand if this was the case for, say, China, or Vietnam. There are other considerations to make with investments in these countries, such as the tenuous relationship with the US, potential meddling by the state in the economy, etc, all of which have gone on for at least ten years and so could account for a net loss in any ETFs tracking their economy due to justified fear, uncertainty, and doubt. But what can account for the situation of the Philippines, for example, where an investment made 10 years ago would today be worth 70% of its original cost, despite the economy growing by roughly 50 percent during the same time period? Again, this seems to be a common situation across many of the foreign investment options available to US retail investors. And of course, this is assuming that some semblance of an option even exists in the first place, which isn't the case for many countries that otherwise seem to have economies large/optimistic enough to be seemingly attractive investments.

What's the explanation for this? And are there any solutions? Most of the resources I found online simply advised people to invest in generalized international ETFs, if they wanted their portfolio to have exposure to e.g. Botswana. But if I wanted to more directedly invest in foreign countries that don't have specific ETFs tracking their economy, or if I wanted to invest in e.g. the Philippines without buying an ETF that only seems to lose value despite the steady growth of the fundamentals it is supposed to track, would there be any way to do so?"|0.69|18.0|0.0|18.0

I have been investing since I was 19 and wanted to be very aggressive.

I've been really fascinated with the idea of financial freedom since then but it's led me to do things I regret. I bought a crappy used car that cost me more than it was worth because in my attempt to be ""frugal"" I bought a car that needed thousands in repairs when I should have bought a more expensive car, which ironically would have been cheaper. 

it's led me to staying at home with my mom at 23 now, saving up as much as I can so I could afford a down payment with an FHA loan to get my own place and start house hacking because i want to move out, but rents are just insanely expensive. but because I've been so hyper focused on purchasing my own property and saving, i don't enjoy life that much right now. I work 15 an hour and I rarely ever buy clothes, go out to eat, etc. and I stopped investing to save up and I wanted to get it asap.

but I see my friends going out on vacations to see other friends in states, having their own privacy (even if it is expensive), going out to eat A LOT, doing fun stuff, and I just feel sad. with my depression, I desperately need something different. I'm thinking about just selling my investments, finding my own apartment, paying rent anyway and just giving up on saving for a down payment any time soon, visit my far away friends and go out more, and just try to live life.

with my current cash on hand and current portfolio value, I'd have around 10,000. the majority of my net worth always was in my investments. I just don't know what to do anymore.

To set the picture, my job and my spouses have plans that are guaranteed but you can only put aside so much. 

We then discovered IRA and max it.

My kids have 529s.

Over the last 3 years I was in crypto but also started single stock investing. 

I have built a portfolio over the last 2 years of about 34k in higher dividend stocks. No less than 6% up to 14% with a mix of about 9.5% of current value.

Now some pay monthly but most quarterly. 

So the last several years have been nuts. My IRA that I have maxed for several years has seen a total return, through vanguard, of 8.6% over the last 6 years due to the ups and downs. 

Dividend stocks also go up and down but they pay you. So good example is I have a stock that I purchase $10 a day. Currently it sits at just at 10% if dividends continue. This stock I am up .02% today but it has paid me 11.3% in dividends which I used to buy other stocks and more of this stock. 

I have that money, it’s mine. It’s working. Where as “growth” doesn’t actually compound. At the end of 2021 my IRA was up over 16k it’s now only up about 8.7k. So that money has actually done nothing for me over the last 2 years. I’ve actually just lost money and due to inflation it’s worth even less. 

My buddy said dump in VOO which I have and my Ira is a similar product from vanguard. That’s my point though, the dividends pay me now. So I can reinvest it and I’m actually gaining. If I plan to hold 15 years I just care they keep paying dividends not what the price is day to day.

Most other sources cite the same pair of benefits, it's not only my relative spouting this. This seems insane. Why can't I get my head wrapped around why people claim this?

It seems to me that premiums received over time are either 1) income on your true, original, and unchanging cost basis that you can consider a ROI the moment you are paid such premium, OR 2) a reduction of your cost basis each moment you are paid such premium and that you can't consider a ROI until the underlying is either assigned or sold. I don't see how you can have both accounting functions occurring at the same time. One of them is a free lunch if you sit down and try to eat them at the same time. No way.

The income is either generating cash on your actual invested capital, or the income is reducing your costs basis ""on the books""until such time that you sell the basket of goods you purchased (in this case equity shares of a publicly traded company). If I ran out and bought groceries with my collected premium, the money is spent. I can't also AND AT THE SAME TIME, say that the same money that was spent at the grocery store is reducing my cost basis. It has to be one or the other.

Tell me I'm wrong. I thank you greatly."|0.73|16.0|0.0|16.0

t3_14ges2o|1687467381.0|investing|Can someone explain what happens in these two scenarios I have below in regards to capital gains tax?|"Example 1:

I buy 1 share of 1 stock for $100. One month later, the stock drops to $90. Then, another month later, the price rises to $95. I then sell the share at $95 dollars. Because I have held the asset for under 1 year, I understand that it is subject to a short term capital gain tax. However, since the stock is worth less than what I bought it for, my understanding is that even though the price has risen from $90 to $95 there is no capital gains tax because the asset is worth less than the initial purchase price. Am I correct in saying this?

Example 2:

I am 18 years old with no income. Therefore, I am not subject to a long term capital gains tax if I only gain $100 dollars before I sell a stock. At 18, I buy 1 share of a stock for $100. I hold the stock until I turn 22, and the share is now worth $200. I am not subject to a long term capital gains tax because I have no earned income during this time. At 22 I get a job, earning 50k per year. At 25, I am still holding the share, and it is now worth $300. I sell the asset at $300. Do I only pay the long term capital gains tax on the amount earned from age 22 to 25 since I was ineligible to pay long term capital gains tax from 18-22, or do I have to pay tax on the $200 gained since age 18? If I were to sell the stock at 22 for $200 and then immediately buy it back for $200, would this allow me to not pay the tax on the $100 gained when the asset rose from $100 to $200?

Sorry if this seems like common sense or rudimentary, I’m trying to have a comprehensive understanding of the market."|0.5|0.0|0.0|0.0

The initial investment will be between $250k-$350k which is currently wrapped up in the home she lives in. Initial investment will come from proceeds from the sale of her home, so she will need somewhere to live after selling (cant figure out if its best to buy or rent.

 - 15 % in cash (saving accounts between 3-4% in my country, money easily accessible)
 - 15 % in crypto (a bit too much but that was already there...one day i'll rebalance!)

 - pick a global index or something US-based ?
 - what kind of duration ?
 - use a dated fund or simply an ETF of bonds ?
 - a mix of HY and Investment grade or maybe only Investment grade?

I have always considered them to be a sensible practice, yet have never used them.  I'll give some personal examples of how they can benefit, and how they might not benefit.

Rivian stock.  IPO was 75 dollars, soared around 125 then plummeted.  Currently around 15.  A stop loss could have salvaged the loss at the original 75 price point.

Microsoft stock.  I was holding the stock when it hit 320 a couple of years ago.  The stock slid down to low 200's, but is now over 330.  A stop loss would have prevented me from going all the way down to 220, but here's the rub.  If I sell a stock I'm less likely to jump back into a stock.  Two reasons, first the feeling that the stock burned me and I don't want to get burned again, second the price point to high to consider reentry, and how high do I imagine the stock will actually go anyway.

I would love to hear from people who use stop losses.  Do you ever go back to the same stock?  Have you felt their use to be worthwhile?  How close to current value do you place your stop loss?"|0.54|1.0|0.0|1.0

These are public companies with major product lines enjoyed particularly by white girls, who possess disposable income and the ability to set cultural trends.

The index had annualized returns of \~17% over 5 years and \~13% over 10 years, you can see the chart [here](https://i.imgur.com/fRHRgLl.jpg).

There were 22 stocks in the index, some of them weren't public 10 years ago, so I included them only after they IPO-d. The best and worst performers in terms of 5 year returns are below. I've not included and ""new"" White Girl Index stocks that went public after the original post in 2018.

1. DECK: +59%
2. ETSY: +55%
3. LULU: +42%

2. UAA: -17%
3. GOOS: -17%
4. SNAP: -6%
5. DIS: -4%

Overall, 16 of the companies had positive returns and 6 had negative returns. What I learnt from the analysis is that there are a bunch of ""superstars"" within this group, whos returns easily compensate for the laggards.

I have 83k in cash, say 65K investable principle with some emergency cash left in savings. I can save an additional 1k-1.5k per month to additional invest. 

I predict I'd need somewhere in the ball park of 250-300k to buy the house, renovations, subtract capital gains, comfortably,  etc as a goal amount for what I'm looking to do and where I'm looking.. The 5-10 years is a moving target as far as I'm concerned and the goal is more important

 (although I'd rather take an increased risk at achieving the goal faster) 

Meaning that the goal is feasible within 5 years if I took increased risked and average 15% returns per say (per interest calculators) but If I ended not beating the market I could still reach my goal in 10 years at 7% return average. Obviously, doing poorer than that I'd have to expand my time horizon (assuming my income does not increase and I cannot increase my investment per month). 

Anyways this investor sub highly advised me against using a FA due to fee's and seemed confused by the proposed portfolio my advisor suggested to me, and I understand there are generally some solid funds out there mostly universally recommended (vanguard). I get lost in the weeds easily and any number of searches can lead you to varying opinions on even what a optimal selection of VG mutual funds might be for any particular situation. They all look good to me when I look at the returns over time.

VTSNX - 10% for int'l exposure (no other options)

VBTIX - 10% for bonds (other options include VMFXX and FTKFX)

2. I read somewhere that VIIIX doesn't get complete domestic exposure, but the only other indexes/funds I can invest in are VFTAX, VIEIX, and VSIAX. From what I'm reading about the funds, I would be essentially double dipping along with VIIIX correct?
3. I have a HYSA that offers 4% kept for emergency funds. Do people generally count this as a part of their investment portfolio? For example if I have 20k in my HYSA, 70k stocks, 10k bonds, would this be a 70/30 split (with HYSA) or a 87.5/12.5 split (without HSYA)?

This is something I've been thinking about ever since I started investing. I have tried googling it, but haven't found any article tackling the question. The PE ratio reflects how much investors are willing to pay for a company's earnings. Over time money supply increases and at the same time more and more people are taking interest in investing - and especially in the stock market. The digital world and the new simplicity of investing in stocks are making the stock market more and more widely available to everyone, and the more people are getting in, the more you will have to pay for what you're purchasing. 

In contrast to most other purchasable items like phones, food or homes, the stock market has a ""fixed quantity"" to sell. Not really a fixed quantity per se, but a fixed income or a fixed EPS. What I mean by that is that no matter how much money enters the market, companies will not earn more because of it. So if money is being printed and new people are coming into the market, you have to be willing to pay more to get the same stock as before.

Everywhere I read articles are referring to historical averages when it comes to PE, but why isn't it mentioned that it makes sense that the PE is rising? Right now SP500's PE is at 25 which is historically high, but we also know that there's still an enormous amount of money sitting on the sideline waiting to enter the market because people are still waiting for a new correction.

TL;DR It today's PE actually OK (or even low?) and should we expect the PE to gradually increase over time as more people are entering the stock market?"|0.59|3.0|0.0|3.0

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently trying to brainstorm things that may factor into the decision to invest in a company that doesn't rely wholly on impulse. Here are some potential categories that may eventually turn into some sort of journaling or flowchart. I'd love your input as well.

\-What is the short interest? (How many days to cover all shorts based on average volume and total shorted shares? 8 days supposedly it gets hairy for bears)

\-What is the volatility?

\-What pattern is emerging or is it trading?

\-Why is it trading higher or lower? (faith in the product, news, cult of personality, faith in leadership, hedging against presumed cycles, et cetera)

\-Is it near support or resistance?

\-What is the price in relation to moving averages? (9, 20, 50, 200 day)

\-Has there recently been a cross up/down?(Seemingly very reactive on the 4 hour chart)

\-Is it filling a gap?

\-What volume is the price based on? (One trader accidentally paying way over market value at 5 AM doesn't mean everyone is going to pay that)

\-Are fund managers likely buying? (you don't affect the market, they do)

\-Is this a long-term or a short-term play?

\-Some people trade the same stocks every day--What does the chart tell you about their habits? (Does volume drop off at a certain time? Do bears take over early only for the stock to rebound? Does everyone seem to take a long lunch away from their trade station?)

\-Price to book ratio? (If they liquidated today, how much would they still have?)

\-Is this stock moving in sympathy with and industry? (Are there cheaper stocks in this industry trading in sympathy that you could increase profit potential with?)

\-What's coming down the pike? (For instance, currently Tesla is dominating because their charging stations are becoming the industry standard. Also in the news is that Honda and other companies are signing on to an agreement to use blockchain to trace the footprint of the minerals used in their batteries. If this becomes a regulation/requirement, will Tesla drop if less-than-scrupulous sources of lithium are discovered?)

\-Based on your own experience, what might you be able to forecast that others may not due to proximity? (E.G. How many fuel trucks can you see going into the pipelines, how many new fracking rigs can you see from the road, What are the names on the rigs? Et cetera)((Ben Graham said not to invest in things you don't understand, right? You don't understand AI--stay out))

\-Before earnings, what products have you noticed more of in your daily life?

t3_14dzzz7|1687232728.0|investing|How is everyone splitting their ETF/Mutual/Index funds?|"Hey guys, I've been investing for the last few years and just recently started my career and wanted to gauge a bit what the best way to split up my funds investments. I know there isn't really a straight answer to this but I think it would be great to get some opinions on the matter.

Right now, all I'm investing in is FXAIX (S&amp;P 500). I understand that this is probably the best one stop shop for general long term investing, but I'm wondering if this is putting all my eggs in one basket (in terms of funds).

After some research, it looks like things International, Total World, Nasdaq Composite, Large Cap and Bonds are probably the biggest other go-tos when it comes to splitting up investments. Some outperform the S&amp;P 500 but are obviously riskier (Nasdaq and Large cap), and some don't (International, and obviously bonds). I find it a bit hard to understand why I would want to diminish returns with any of the International ones, or even bonds when the S&amp;P is almost guaranteeing returns...

My question is: Is it even worth it to split up funds investments when the S&amp;P500 is already pretty diversified? And if yes, is there some kind of split that some of you swear by that you would recommend to a riskier investor in their 20s? (80-10-10 for S&amp;P, international, bonds maybe?). I'd love to hear where people stand on splits in their portfolios."|0.58|2.0|0.0|2.0

t3_14dwqxk|1687223628.0|investing|Canada: Seeking input regarding bank's handling of investments|"I recently went to my bank for a review of my investments in my TFSA, as they had not been performing as well as I had hoped, so I was looking for a change. Over the 4 years I've been investing, I have had an overall gain of about 2%, though the documents they have for those specific portfolios showed an average of close to 10% over that time. We went through different options, and settled on some ETFs, mostly equity based. Closed out the previous portfolios, transferred the funds over to the new ones, signed everything and called it a day, no issues. 

The following week, the assistant branch manager left me a voicemail and follow-up email saying she needed to speak with me about my investments, saying it was urgent, and that the changes might not be right for me and if I didn't get back to them soon they would need to revert back to my old portfolio. 

When I called back, she said she was doing an audit of the changes, and that the risk level of the new ETFs did not match my investor portfolio. She asked me if I was aware of the risk level (I was, of course the employee I spoke with went over that when discussing options), and if I was okay with it (again, of course this was discussed and I obviously signed forms indicating so), then proceeded to go through a generic questionnaire about my investment goals and risk tolerance. Ex: what % of gain or loss are you comfortable with? if your investments took a significant decline, what would you do? how much of your total savings does this account represent? etc.

I honestly was quite annoyed that this questionnaire was being treated as urgent, as I had taken time out of my work day to address this (I don't have reliable cell signal at work, so I had to leave to return her call). This felt like a) a check in the box for them that was probably important on their end for their own internal stats, but not a priority for me, and b) something that should have been done in the appointment I had at the bank, if it was necessary in order to make the adjustment. It felt like she did not trust her own staff at all, and that this was basically a cover your ass thing for their business. Anyway, I answered all of the questions, and then she said that based on my responses, that would put me as a ""growth"" investor, but I would need to be an ""aggressive"" investor for the new portfolio, so either I would need to change back to something similar to what I had before, or change my responses to align with the new stuff. I said I was happy with what I signed up for, and had signed all of the consent forms indicating I was okay with the risk, so I didn't understand the issue. She then said she would adjust the answers for me, basically through trial and error so that it would pop out ""aggressive"" in its calculation, and send it to me to sign. That sounded shady, but I needed to get back to work so I said okay and we ended the call.

She emailed me the electronic document close to the end of the work day, asking me to sign and return it by the end of business, which was not possible as I was working. I briefly looked at it later that evening, and saw that the document had a deadline for signature of about 5 days later, so I put it away as I had more pressing matters, and this did not feel like a priority for me, as I had already completed all of the actual paperwork to set up the new investment portfolio at the bank. The next morning, she called multiple times, left voicemails, and sent emails, basically begging me to sign this form, and again said if I didn't get the form signed by the end of the day, they would need to revert my investments back to what they were previously. I highly doubt they could do this without me consenting to it, so again I'm not particularly rushed by this scare tactic. I suspect adjusting the questionnaire is primarily to prevent them from getting their hands slapped by their superiors, which is not my concern.

I finally am looking through the document in detail, and the answers to the questions she asked are not at all the answers I gave, which I know she said was what she would do. But it doesn't feel right to sign this, as I know these answers are blatantly false. I know it's not necessarily a legal document in the sense that I could face consequences for being untruthful, but it still does not seem like the right thing to do. I feel like the appropriate option for a situation like this is to have a consent form saying you acknowledge and accept that the risk level does not match with your stated risk tolerance, not artificially changing the responses.

This whole situation is making me seriously consider moving my money elsewhere. The problem is I know basically nothing about investing, and am not prepared to take on a more hands-on approach, so going through the bank is just so much easier.

What are your impressions on this situation, and what advice would you give?"|0.74|15.0|0.0|15.0

Not to talk much major points were:
1- more derivative meant exponential risk.
2- market collapse of 1998, 2008 was:
  * one fall of a big player did a domino effect.
  * could come of a devaluation of baht in Thailand ( all markets are connected)
* wall street has something smelly powered by greed, so a $1 billion dollar swaps could become a layered $10 billion birthday cake, risk is not calculated by complexity theory but by Var, hence the one bank goes bk all the rest falls.
* bail in is the next move by government not bail out like in 2008 (printing money) but using uninsured depositors money like in 2015-2017 Cyprus and Greece. 
3- government can freeze whole market in crisis situations till they figure out what to do.
4- regulators/washington are always last to  know of upcoming avalanche because again banks greed/control of Washington.

I can't confirm that all this is absolute truth, but was definitely eye opener hence my questions:

1- what's the amount insured in 401k and IRA accounts.
2- what if a collapse/freeze/bail in happens when I'm 62 and can't wait another 5-10 years for market to bounce back.
3- what if markets don't bounce back."|0.33|0.0|0.0|0.0
t3_14dttff|1687216011.0|investing|US: taxes and traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA - what makes sense here?|"So I just started investing / setting aside money in a Roth IRA. My pre tax income is a little over 70k. My tax rate is around 24% (?). I don’t have an employer sponsored 401 (k) so cannot match. I am a first-gen WOC and am 30, so starting late but haven’t had stable work. 

I had thought that investing in a Roth was win-win. You pay with after tax dollars and never have to worry about RMDs and paying taxes in the future (ofc nothing is guaranteed and the gov could change the rules decades from now and find a sneaky way to have you pay taxes on them - you never know)…

However, when I went to do my taxes this year, my accountant said that I should’ve invested in an IRA one a Roth, meaning I get tax benefits now and more in my pocket (which I could then immediately invest). The reason for this strategy by my accountant is that 1. I really don’t see myself working until retirement age (in my culture it’s very rare to find women working much the older we are) 2. Therefore I won’t be at a higher income bracket than what I am today’s.

My questions:
1. How do they calculate what is owed and roughly what tax bracket I could be at? Let’s say I contribute between 15-35% of my income into stocks and bonds (going the Bogle route) 
2. Surely my tax bracket would be the lowest if I’m not working? 
3. Or are my investments my earnings? 

This is significant because now I’m super unsure whether I continue ploughing into my Roth or change my strategy and get tax benefits now and a reduced rate later. 

I have terrible maths so I don’t understand how to calculate, plus I’m foreign-born so only now understanding investing and taxes in the U.S. 

Why would it make sense to invest/max my IRA over a Roth? I could do with an extra $$$ from tax deductible amount but would it hurt me in the long term? Would it make sense to set up a call with an advisor to discuss the above? Would love to get your feedback."|0.68|11.0|0.0|11.0

t3_14do6ut|1687203098.0|investing|What Recession? Wall Street's China Trap and the first step to not falling into it.|"Let's talk about the incessant recession headlines that have been dominating the news lately. Initially centered on the United States, the focus has now shifted to a so-called ""worldwide"" recession. However, it's crucial to question the prevailing narrative and critically analyze the situation. While high interest rates in the US and globally may raise concerns, the news often presents a different story. Let's break free from the moneyed Wall Street trap and explore the reality.

Intel's Strategic Investments: A Positive Outlook

Contrary to the recession narrative, Intel is actively investing billions worldwide to address the challenges in Chinese supply chains. This shows a long-term commitment to solving the issues rather than a harbinger of economic downturn.

India's Record Order: A Sign of Economic Strength

The recent Paris Airshow witnessed India's historic order of 500 airplanes just this morning, hinting at a robust economic outlook. Notably, India's significance in this context cannot be overlooked, suggesting potential growth opportunities outside of China.

Challenging the Perception:My theory diverges from the prevailing belief that a recession is imminent. I argue that perceived shocks and market drops are often linked to those who deliberately choose to ignore the economic situations in Western Europe and the USA, which stand in contrast to a challenging environment in China. China's youth unemployment rate and the need for additional stimulus amid an already heated economic climate provide evidence of this. Moreover, concerns about China's real estate bubble raise more than just eyebrows for the informed investor.

Investment Strategies:Given the current market climate, it becomes crucial to identify companies that are not trading at all-time highs but possess significant growth potential. You do not want to buy VOO at ATH or the mega cap tech stocks at ATH.

One Investable example is TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), which remains undervalued despite its long-term prospects. While TSMC's US factory investment is noteworthy, the key play lies in the belief that China is unlikely to invade Taiwan in the next two decades. This perspective aligns with the global will, barring any extreme actions by Xi Jinping resembling Mao's regime. If you are not aware, believe me when I say that the Xi is aware that a dozen well placed ships could block all middle eastern oil shipments from reaching China, destroying the economy, even if they could blockade Tawain. Berkshire Hathaway would potentially invest billions in TSMC if it were not entangled in Chinese interests, highlighting the company's strong position. Intel is another strong example.

While the prevailing narrative warns of a looming recession, it is essential to challenge these assumptions and examine the global economic landscape more objectively. By identifying undervalued companies with significant growth potential, such as TSMC, long-term investors can seek opportunities in the market. Depending on reception of my write up, I'll share other investment ideas if there's interest as I have identified several.

TL:DR Wall Street has way too much money in China, they need to offload it to under-informed investors in an enviroment like this.

It's worth noting I do not live in the USA.

I currently have about 120k in savings and am looking to buy an apartment. My price range has been around 280-320k for a doer upper, hoping to use as little a down payment (60-70k) as possible in order to use the rest for for refurbishment and decoration. I recently just found out I'm going to inherit about 100k which obviously changes things.

I've started to wonder, what if I bought a rental property now. A ready to walk into for 290k, down payment of 70k. I could immediately rent this property out having that income cover mortgage, insurance and tax.

This would leave me with about 150k to purchase a home I really like. Again, doer upper of about 280-320k, small as possible down payment, more money for refurbishment and maybe some savings for a rainy day.

Would this be a smart move? Do banks allow this kind of debt? Am I underestimating how much all this might cost?

I've been diligently building my ETF portfolio in my Roth IRA, but lately, I've been questioning whether I have too many ETFs and if there's potential overlap or duplication issues. I want to ensure that my investments are as diverse as possible, but I'm not confident in my investing knowledge. That's why I need your expertise and feedback on my current holdings!

Here's my portfolio list:

1. Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)
2. MSCI Inc. (MSCI)
3. Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)
4. Tesla, Inc. (TSLA)
5. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)
6. Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ)
7. Fidelity Government Money Market Fund (SPAXX)
8. SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)
9. Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (VOO)
10. Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)
11. Vanguard Target Retirement 2060 Fund (VTTSX)
12. Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE)

I'm genuinely concerned that I may have too much overlap or duplicates among these ETFs, potentially undermining the diversification I was aiming for. Additionally, as a relatively inexperienced investor, I would greatly appreciate your thoughts on the overall health of my portfolio."|0.5|0.0|0.0|0.0

Mathematically speaking, if I buy 1 random stock out of sp500, the expected returns of my portfolio is extremely under diversified. If I by all the stocks of sp500, I have almost identical returns as an index fund, but doing it would be a lot of work. 

In my understanding it would make sense to pick e.g. 20 or 50 stocks from sp500 by random and own them instead of buying an index fund. It is diversified and doesn't cost me yearly fee. It has only a bit bigger risk than sp500 index fund, but on average should give better result.

My question is what do you think about this. For me this sounds like a good strategy, but I haven't seen any investing advice like this. I wonder if maybe you heard some critique of such approach, or maybe some research paper that analyzes it?

She apparently didn't like the FA that was managing the money for my grandparents so she found a new one closer to her home. 

Before she transferred the money there, I asked her a few times to let me see what the FA was proposing before she signed on but she never did. Now she sent me a few pics of the folio (she's not good with technology) and asked me what I think about the strategy he's put in place. I have limited info so far as I'm trying to get all the pieces and log in info from her, but the image shows the key holdings for half of the portfolio.

For context, she is divorced, 64 and semi-retired, not drawing SS yet. Owns a home and has no outstanding debt other than the mortgage. I don't know how much is left on the principle, but she downsized over the years so she's doing pretty well in that regard. She personally has about 100k in her own savings and 401(k), and possibly some other money I'm not aware of. She's by no means rich so she has to be somewhat conservative with her financial planning for retirement. 

It seems this FA has put some in cash and a MMF, ok fine. But he put her in all preferred stocks and corporate bonds which I have little experience with. The other 100k is in an annuity which I haven't been able to see the paperwork on yet so I don't know the details. Link below to the holdings.

From what I can tell, I think he's tried to put her into vehicles that will offer high dividends with low growth potential (and low""er"" risk). I'm hoping for a second opinion as I only have an retail investor level of knowledge. 

  
What are your thoughts on this strategy? Is there any growth potential over the next few - several years? Any suggestions I can take back to this FA if I can get a meeting with him?

Buy one and you're virtually guaranteed to earn the easily understood/found interest rate. I understand there's things like interest rate risk, which if I understand correctly just means if you were to sell early and interest rates went up, the bond price went down so you'd earn a lower return, or you'd be stuck at the rate you bought the bond at.

But for corporate bonds, I'm not sure how to understand/find the interest rates. On fidelity's chart [here](https://fixedincome.fidelity.com/ftgw/fi/FILanding#tbcurrent-yields|highest-yield), it shows them having a lower rate than treasuries, but for reasons I don't quite understand, I've read that the numbers listed there aren't accurate rates for corporate bonds. 

If I search for actual bonds it shows three yield numbers, one under bid and two (yield to worst and yield to maturity) under ask. I filtered for A to A+ bonds, and at the top is John Deere and the yield under bid is over 11%, but the yield to worst/to maturity is half that. What do these numbers mean?"|0.84|32.0|0.0|32.0

If you are 40 years old, some traditional advice might be to have a 60/40 portolio.    But why so much bonds?  Is it really wise to hold those bonds for 20 years or longer?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I see another recent post aking for advice between FXNAX and FTKFX.  Those funds are down -10.11% and -11.90% respectively over there lifetime.  I know the past doesn't predict the future but the track record is not good and there seems to be better alternitives.    What am I missing?  Many people smarter than I invest in bonds,  I've heard Warren Buffet say to mix with bonds, so what gives?  "|0.42|0.0|0.0|0.0

Do you get some kind of document from your broker at the end of the year with your realized profits/losses?

My point? That you should have listened to me? No. I didn’t make any predictions. But **my point is no one knows!** At 62YO and having been investing all my adult life, I’ve seen so many cases where these expert prognosticators are wrong. Generally their whole prediction is to take the current situation and project that our for the next 12-18 months. Honestly they are wrong so often that now I kinda have the opposite reaction – they predict a bright future and I get worried, they predict a recession and I’m hopeful.

Why is it that the ETF I'm invested in right now, one that holds cash with our major banks up here, pays better distributions (about 4.5%) than any bond ETF I've looked at (which, whether government/municipal or investment-grade corporate, vary between 3.2 and 3.7% based on today's price, never mind the much higher price of a year ago)?

As far as I can reckon, this must be because investment sentiment is towards significant rate cuts in the short term (let's say one to three years). But that seems a fairly big spread just for the sake of something that \*might\* happen. Or is is because of required holdings? Or demand for a familiar product? Or what?

I just can't wrap my head around having to pay a premium for something that's less liquid, more volatile (yes, rates might go down, or they might go up even more, for all we know, but at least my cash is cash), of a comparable risk profile\*, and at present is showing worse growth.

I'm sure I'm missing something big here, so enlighten me, please!

\* These ETF deposits aren't secured, but neither are the bonds in the ETFs, and the Canadian banking system, for all its many many faults, appears relatively secure and, if not secure, then so monopolistically integrated into the country's fabric that ""too big to fail"" is probably reasonable, at least for cash deposits."|0.36|0.0|0.0|0.0

Thoughts on how to lock in the gain until I'm able to sell at the long term tax rate?  
If I buy ATM puts, I'd be paying \~10% premium for 8 months protection -- at the very least this would be better than selling today as I'd end up paying less (long term tax + premium &lt; short term tax) and have further upside.  But 10% premium feels high to me for 8 months.  
If I buy puts 20% below current price, that would be a 4% premium.  This might make the most sense in terms of reducing premium, having complete upside, and locking in \~half of the gains.

Not exactly an expert on banking sector but i intend to get started.

We all know about the mini financial crisis like situation from March - April but it seems like the situation has stabilized now. Of course, no one can predict when the next bank would fail but we can say with some amount of certainty that his hard to see a major bank failing at this point.

Considering this, why is it that BAC is still so close to it's 52 week low price? Looking at their NII and overall numbers, it seems like they are doing really well and if interest rates are not going to go down sharply for another 1-2 years, they are expected to make really good NII growth. **So why is the price still low?**

With JPM, it feels more and more that US will avoid a severe recession and at worst, recession would be quite mild. Business activities especially in service sector are still in a fairly good shape or at least in the expansion zone. This should definitely work in favor of commercial banks such as jpm or MS or GS.

I was concerned with this but had alternative options in case my options wouldn’t be able to cover what I needed though. 

Anyways so what realistic emergencies could happen where one would need access to liquid savings in an immediate time frame? Job loss probably the most likely option but how often does anyone get fired without an inkling to prepare for a loss of income? Say it does happen how much worse off would you be if you took a 401k loan or even suck up the penalty from taking it from a traditional IRA? Getting a 10% fee and encountering taxes (not sure how this works but if you are unemployed would logic follow your IRA tax rate would be pretty favorable?) would hurt but even over a couple years you would be better off having that spare cash working for you in equities/bonds than a HFY.

Maybe just peace of mind. But I think people often give this answer when they haven’t truly critically examined the situation and what likely situations they could face to need a liquid emergency fund.

I have a few questions that I would like to be answered. It would be of great help if experienced and older individuals could provide me with their insights and advice. The questions:

1. I am interested in investing. I genuinely enjoy researching stocks and would like to expand my knowledge. What books/podcasts can I read/listen to become more knowledgeable? So far, I have read The Psychology of Money, Rich Dad Poor Dad, and The Intelligent Investor.
2. How much should I have saved by now? I have approx. $2k AUD and will have approx. $10k AUD invested into stocks (Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, S&amp;P500) by the time 2023 ends. This is because I live with my parents (typical Asian household) and plan to for several years. Furthermore, with this saved money, should I do something else or just continue to invest in stocks? Ps. I know a lot of people will tell me that ""You are young, you should travel"". Don't worry, I am not putting everything I earn into my portfolio and plan to spend some money on traveling to countries.
3. I cannot do the typical ""9-5"" job and follow the ""rat race"". I know some people that do, and some of those people are happy, but I am just saying I cannot do it. Thus, I plan to work till 30, saving around 60% of all the money I earn, putting it into my portfolio, letting compound interest do its magic, and then retiring. Any ideas on how I can accelerate this? Or just any other tips/advice.
4. Would really appreciate your insights. Thanks : )"|0.36|0.0|0.0|0.0

They used the buffet indicator (stock market cap / GDP) to predict future returns. They mentioned the shiller PE ratio, but did not do an in-depth analysis on that, so I decided to do so myself.

Data used:

SPX monthly price from tradingview  1935 - 2023

Monthly Shiller PE from Nasdaq data link 1935 - 2023

&amp;#x200B;

Method:

For each monthly data point, I calculated the future annual returns on a 20, 10, and 5 year time frame. I then created three regression models with the shiller PE as the independent variable and future return as the dependent variable. I ran the three regression models from 1935 till present day as well as from 1985 till present day (6 models total). 

&amp;#x200B;

Results (1980-2023):

At the current shiller PE of 29,54 we can expect a twenty year annual return of **5,43%**, a ten year return of **4,57%** and a five year return of **5,18%**. 

* 20y -  5,43%
* 10y -  4,57%
* 5y - 5,18%

&amp;#x200B;

Results (1935-2023):

At the current shiller PE of 29,54 we can expect a twenty year annual return of **4,3%**, a ten year return of **2,55%** and a five year return of **3,34%**.

* 20y - 4,3%
* 10y -  2,55%
* 5y - 3,34%

Each of the regression models has a higher R\^2 value for  the period 1980 - 2023 than for the period 1935 - 2023. I suspect this is because the market has significantly changed since the **digital revolution**. Due to the nature of digital products and services, future growth is expected to be higher. **Higher growth** results in **higher valuations** and **higher expected future returns** for any given earning multiple. Therefore, a regression model over the entire period 1935 - 2023 would try to capture two inherently different  relations between PE and expected future return leading to higher variance and lower R\^2. 

As I expected, the regressions with longer term future results have lower variance and therefore a higher R\^2 value. Meaning that for both time periods, the 20y model performs better than the 10y model which performs better than the 5y model. This makes me think of the saying;  in the short term, the stock market is a voting machine while it is a weighing machine in the long term. This seems to be confirmed by the data. 

The 20y model for the period 1980-2023 has the highest predictive value with an R\^2 of 0,81.

t3_149brag|1686758843.0|investing|$DAC - Analysis and DD - A 2023 Deep Value Play|"**INTRODUCTION**

The Danaos Corporation ($DAC) is a freight charter company. It is heavily undervalued by numerous metrics - trading at a EV/EBITDA of 1.89, 0.52 P/B, a 3.52x P/E, and a 0.18x Debt/Equity multiple. As a freight charter company which owns the majority of its vessels, it is not directly subject to changing freight rates, although it is exposed to changing supply and demand as well as high capital dependance. Companies in the shipping industry are often viewed as a risky investment due to low ROCs and heavy competition - however, this company is currently at a massive discount, and its exposure to risk is limited as 2/3 of the current revenue is contracted until 2025 at the (high) COVID-19 spot rates. Furthermore, these contracts are with liners that are in great financial health, due to the previous few years of high cash flows in the shipping industry. As of June 13, 2023, the average contract for their fleet is at 20 months. $100 million in share buybacks were announced in 2022, of which $40 million have already been purchased. Currently, there is a 4.73% annual dividend yield with a payout ratio of approximately 11.9%.

**GENERAL RISKS**

The firm is at its highest ever point in free cash flow - contracted EBITDA locked in contracts over the next 3 years are more than its current Enterprise Value. With the high amount of earnings that are already locked in contracts, the only valid risk at this time are the spot rates their vessels will be subject to in the future in the case of a recession. However, this risk only applies to the 1/3 of revenue that is not locked in future contracts. Going into the future, newly imposed environmental regulations may cause reduced revenue when considering the fact that new vessels will be introduced to the market 2023 onwards, and environmental checks required for older ships may increase future costs. I do anticipate that this risk is currently overblown for Danaos because of it's sizable young portion of its fleet. Given that it is a charter company and not a liner, it faces less exposure to volatility. The return on Capital averages at 7-11%, which is not a high amount. The 0.52x NAV multiple does provide significant downside protection, however.

**MANAGEMENT**

Dr. John Coustas is the current CEO and President of the company. He assumed management of the company from his father (who founded the company in 1982) in 1987. He holds degrees in Marine Engineering, Computer Science, and Computer Controls. With a 44% stake, CEO John Coustas is the largest shareholder. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 2.4% and 2.3% of the stock. His stake likely means he is largely in charge of decisions made at the company. Given he has over 30 years in shipping experience with the firm, he may place his main incentive on steady growth instead of attempting to maximize shareholder returns, although this might be balanced by other incentives due to his large stake in the company. The average age of a vessel on the Danaos fleet is 11 years - for reference, depreciation of these vessels starts at ages ranging from 25-30 years. It is possible that current older vessels may be used for additional periods due to the obscenely high recent spot rates (this may be reduced after the intiation of environmental regulation) Around $530 million was committed in 2021 to building 6 new vessels, which will be delivered in 2024. Prior to this, another 6 second hand vessels were purchased for $270 million in 2021- these second hand vessels have currently yielded around 8% in adjusted earnings. The company was under extensive strain after the GCF until COVID due to a high level of debt and low charter rates - this prior history may impact the actions which the management of the company undertake with their current cash.

**RELIABILITY OF LONG TERM CONTRACT CUSTOMER BASE**

Due to the recent increase in cash flows which shipping companies experienced during COVID, large numbers of shipping companies are in extremely (historically) healthy financial positions. Furthermore, the majority of Danaos' contracts are Industry Standard Charter Contracts - this means that they are not cancellable and are not subject to renegotiation or change unless in the case of a restructuring or bankruptcy. In past years (during which the shipping industry was under far greater strain than it is now), Danaos received full compensation from ZIM when it restructured in 2014 in addition to when HMM restructured in 2016 in the form of equity. However, in the case of Hanjin's bankruptcy, no vessel owners received compensation which contributed to Danaos recording a net loss of $366 million in 2016, down from a net profit of $117 Million in 2015 (it is worth noting that the period was also of a general industry turndown). CMA GM (22%), M SC (15%), and HMM (15%) were the 3 biggest charter contract companies for Danaos in 2022.In the Q3 earning call for GSL (a Danaos competitor with a customer base which partly overlaps with the firm), Ian Webber (CEO) said - “Further, we have industry standard charter contracts, they're noncancelable. We only deal with the really good names. We've never had a bad debt in GSL. It kind of doesn't happen in our industry by and large, anyway. Liner companies are desperate for these ships. They need the charter fleet to run their scheduled services. Without the ships, they don't have services. So it's in their own interest to behave properly. And as George said, they're in the best financial shape they've probably ever been in..” - this summarizes my conviction on the matter. The already low risks of customer bankruptcy are also somewhat mitigated by the firms diverse customer base (their largest customer accounts for 25% of their revenue, followed by the second largest customer at approximately 16%). This risk is already low because of the fact that liner companies have recently come out of a cash flow windfall.

**EFFECT OF CONTAINERSHIP AVAILABILITY ON FUTURE CHARTER RATES AND REVENUE**

The magnitude of TEU vessels scrapped decreased from highs in 2016 to \~1% in 2020, to \~0% in 2022. The recent increase in charter rates has caused numerous charter firms to run older ships for additional time in spite of higher operational costs. This increase in vessel deployment and utilization is further evidenced by the fact that the idle fleet ratio has fallen to 1.6% in recent years. Vessel orders have been placed with anticipated deliveries between 2023-2025, and the increase in Danaos' net shipping capacity is \~12.8%. Supply of these ships face a diminishing threat due to environmental regulations which will soon require corrective anti-pollution modifications to a portion of \~80% of the current world fleet which can be classified as aged. Danaos is at a smaller exposure to this risk because of a large number of young vessels it owns. Additionally, the influx in supply of eco-friendly ships to the market in future years may have a damage on Danaos' revenue, but the large number of non-cancelable contracts provides protection against this. The market share is currently concentrated amongst a smaller number of larger liner companies due to many smaller firms having faced bankruptcy in recent years - this increase in supply side power could allow the maintenance of higher freight and therefore charter rates, which could have an adverse effect on the aforementioned supply shifters, benefiting Danaos. To combat the constrictors of supply, significant orders will be met from 2023-2025, and a sizable portion of these orders will be at a capacity over 10000 TEU, while Danaos may have a smaller risk of loss due to its orders which are under 10000 TEU.

**CATALYST**

I think sheer value can act as a catalyst for the stock as it shows consistent earnings due to the contracted future cash flows. More media coverage as the stock increases and shows consistent earnings could also have a similar effect. In recent times, the media coverage has been low due to the fact that the firm was unestablished and not immensely profitable until after COVID."|0.56|2.0|0.0|2.0

What would you recommend me do? I was thinking go heavy on good dividend growth picks or purely dividend picks and and see what we can pull out at 60 or whenever she'd like to retire.

Our current financial situation: she can max out the IRA easily, we have no debt besides a car loan of 10k which will be paid off at the end of the year. She doesn't make a lot of money 40-50k but she saves a lot of her money. No house here as she wants to retire in an Asian country which is a relatively low cost of living, you can probably get by with maybe 500 a month (even less as I'll be helping her).

I currently own a home in a HCOL area. Conservatively, equity is 300k (after factoring in selling expenses, which are very high). My mortgage is just over 550k at 3.5% fixed.

I have 25k in HYSA and 160k in broad-market ETFs. No other liquid assets.

Im going to be moving to a different city in a few years, and I’d like to buy a “forever home” at that point. Current income is 240k/year—assume it stays the same and doesn’t go up.

I’m leaning towards selling my current home and buying. I know the mortgage is a good deal and it’s tempting to rent it out, but I wouldn’t be able to afford any place that I’d be willing to move in to in the new city, which is also HCOL.

My main questions are: how should I invest my excess income from now on? Keep DCA into funds? Or start putting most of it into HYSA for moving expenses/buying costs?

Also, assuming I can scrape together a 500k down payment in 2 years, what’s a reasonable home price? 2 million would mean a 25% down payment, but a 1.5 million mortgage sounds insane."|0.66|10.0|0.0|10.0

Still I am trying to deepen my understanding of various instruments and was hoping you guys might help me out. I have been reading up on warrants I was hoping you guys might confirm my understanding or correct my misunderstanding :)

The online broker i am using has two types of warrants - Call and Put. Both have three characteristics 1) Strike price 2) delta 3) expiry date. Now my understanding is that by buying a call warrant i basicly buy the right to buy shares on a future date for a predefined price. 

Examle: There are Calls on Apple shares. The strike price is USD 128 and the expiry date is 20.12.2024 and delta 0.81. So if i understand correctly by buying 1 warrant for EUR 7 I will have the opportunity to buy 1 Apple shate on 20.12.2024 for USD 128. The delta seems to be an indicator of the volatility of the Warrant.

I am pretty sure i am missing something as this sounds too good to be true. So basicly if i want to invest in Apple instead of investing USD 180 today in 1 Apple share, i could invest (buy) a warrant for EUR 7 with the same idea and if the share prices does increase i could excercise the warrant for USD 128 (USD 50 lower than the price if i buy a share to hold today). If the share price is lower than the strike price i wouldn't excercise the warrant while in the meantime i could have invested my money in other stocks.

I have a similar question for the put warrant but lets see first about the calls as I am pretty sure I am missing something"|0.43|0.0|0.0|0.0

So TBill auctions are held weekly on Thursdays and funds don't settle until the following Tuesday. Say one bought 1mo TBill on 5/4/23 (auction), the real date which you get the bond is 5/9. The bond doesn't pay its coupon until 6/6. However, you'd need to wait until that Thursday, 6/8, to buy the TBill again. That means in these ladders, there is a 1 week delay which you are losing out on interest. Am I right in this regard? Is there a way to ladder it so that there is no period of no interest?

I am considering investing in an actively managed factor based actively managed ETF imagine $DEEP or EYLD 

My biggest hesitancy is the .6-.8% expense ratio but I have started to wonder how etf's tax advantage may meaningfully make up for the expense 

so ultimately in general Is the tax advantage of actively managed ETF's meaningfully vs having to pay capital gains if you were to self apply a factor based strategy with yearly turnover?

And if you have a deep understanding of this topic could you please explain it in as simple of language as you can

My very basic understanding from you tube is that mutual fund even passive ones pass on capital gains taxes when they have any sort of turnover and for any dividends. I have heard that ETF's can have turnover but it might be considered something like ""transfer in kind"".

I replied ([https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33041751](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33041751)) that I purchased some pandemic stocks, which I started doing in April 2022. Most of my purchasing was through summer 2022, but I've bought others more recently, like Carvana on the dip in December (which luckily popped since it became a meme stock), as well as Meta, Amazon and Google on the dips in October. The most recent was Allbirds on the dip in March since I had just purchased the shoes and they quickly became my favorite.

Overall, I'm up 36%, but as you can imagine a few winners (which I luckily have larger stakes in) make up for the losers. My target timeline is \~3 years, and we could still see a deeper recession from a hard landing, so I plan to post more annual updates.

There were multiple lots of some stocks, so I've summarized each with the overall unrealized gain/loss so far as of this morning:

* Affirm: -11.33%
* Amazon: +25.25%
* Allbirds: +9.43%
* Coinbase: -34.32%
* Carvana: +306.5%
* Google: +29.35%

* Shopify: +39.26%
* Snapchat: +3.21%
* Snowflake: +11.14%
* Unity: +8.91%

**Some commentary**

It's hard to convey how much of a roller coaster the the last 12 months have been, with some pretty large negative swings that I just had to watch and not react to. There are likely more to come, especially since it seems a lot of the potential good news is already priced in.

Interestingly, in that post I mentioned Peloton was one I regretted almost instantly, and is now my worst performer by far. Unfortunately, greed got the best of me and I caught that falling knife buying a few times as the stock dropped further. I was hoping they would get rid of the excess inventory, improve distribution and double down on subscriptions to turn things around, but that hasn't materialized. Maybe it still will, or they get acquired.

Despite the strong gains, I still feel Shopify (improved focus, strong brand), Netflix (new ad tier, other new streaming services struggling and likely to go back to content), and Meta (improved targeting post privacy changes + AI opportunities) still have good upside potential.

I also really like Microsoft due to their enterprise moat and opportunities with AI, but their stock never had the correction the other stocks did and that was the scent I was chasing at the time (right or wrong). But long-term, I also wonder if AI will negate the need for human productivity software since the AI can just do it and review/edit mode requires less bloat (e.g. video with Final Cut Pro vs. TikTok, or images with Photoshop vs. Instagram). I wouldn't doubt if we see an AI-native productivity suite that doesn't just integrate AI, but predicated on simplfy reviewing AI generated content.

I'm disappointed to have missed Nvidia (up 3X since October) since I used to own it and have been watching it since the crypto bust created excess inventory and a predictable dip, then the AI trend led to the recovery. The valuation feels rich, but could easily grow into it given the trajectory of AI, unless the hyperscalers make their own chips.

Perhaps counterintuitively, it seems it's more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts than financial analysts/stock pickers since, at the end of the day, you need to make your own decisions about the fundamentals and prospects of the business. Financials are a good indicator of fundamentals, but by definition backward looking while valuation is forward looking.

I'm curious to see how these perform if the US enters a broader recession in the next 18 months. I don't plan to sell unless something catastrophic happens and I see a better opportunity to shift to."|0.85|174.0|0.0|174.0

I’m young and fairly healthy, but I anticipate accessing the funds throughout the year for healthcare expenses. I would like to have somewhat balanced growth and capital preservation, but I also want to be tax efficient.

My thought was something like 

50% GOVZ

30% SCHG (VUG as tax loss partner)

20% XBI   (IBB as tax loss partner)

The zero coupon treasury bond allocation is in anticipation of a long term declining trend in interest rates.

The equities allocation is to keep the dividend yield minimal but leave the potential for growth intact.

An alternate idea is

50% GOVZ

50% VOO (IVV as tax loss partner)

In all cases, I would use new funds to rebalance the allocations and occasionally sell and buy to rebalance as necessary.

* Uniti is a Little Rock, Arkansas-based specialty REIT that acquires and constructs mission-critical communications infrastructure in the form of fiber optics, copper and coaxial broadband networks.
* They own and operate 137,000 fiber route miles covering 275,000 commercial buildings, with most of its network in the Eastern and Midwestern portions of the U.S. It's one of the 10 largest fiber providers in the U.S. today, and its fiber optic leasing generates about 70% of its total revenue.

Now some research.

* President and CEO Kenny Gunderman purchased 225,000 shares of Uniti Group at an average price of $4.37 in the first week of March, amounting to $983,250. These are historic lows for this company. There aren't many investors in a low prices. The CEO has 14,500 shares at $24.15.(Current share price is $4.25 paying a $0.15 dividend on 6/30/2023 and the ex-date is 6/15.)  
Short interests are at 109.44% with only 6.5 days to cover.  
Most recent earnings report, analysts say compared to their peers. Value should be $11.42.
* Windstream is their biggest customer and some debt pushed out further in the future.

When you think about our country, everything runs on the internet. It's the backbone of the digital world. Cell towers, businesses, and residents all require internet and is still expanding. Cell services are moving into the home internet market.

It was very fun, but we ended up staying longer and doing more things than we initially planned, spending about $10k total,  way over initial budget by quite a lot. We just lost track of our budget in the blur of fun. As a result, I had to cut back on retirement contributions this year and I was not happy about it. I kept obsessing over what that 10k might have been 20 years from now, had I invested it instead. But then I had a conversation with a close childhood friend.

This friend's father retired last year having lived the life of a frugal teetotal. He was obsessed with finance and investing. He read every book on the subject that he could and was extremely knowledgeable. I remember him giving my own father advice. He worked at a few different state agencies starting in his mid 20s and continued right up into his early 60s, ending with a low six figure salary. Throughout this time he was extremely frugal and retired with several million in various retirement accounts.

My friend was telling me that growing up, his father never took them on trips, took them out to a fancy restaurant only once a year, bought used/hand-me-down items instead of new things whenever possible, never drank, and in general just did not spend a dime on entertainment. They had board games in the house, and that was about it. I asked him what his favorite memories were of his childhood, and he couldn't really say. In other words, no memories really stood out among the sea of blandness.

I think you know what happens next.

Just one year after his father retired: BAM. Alzheimer's. Rapid onset. He now has severe dementia and will probably die in the next year or two.

The one thing his father did talk about a lot was that he always wanted to see Europe. Greece, Italy, and England in particular. Now that is not possible. He will die never having left the country. He hardly even travelled outside of his own state.

Listening to my friend describe his father's situation was sobering. Investing is, of course, a wise decision. But it should never come at the expense of experiences.

Retirement-aged people can and do have fun. But lets be real. Do you see a lot of 60+ people backpacking through Cambodia? Going bungee jumping? Going to a rave? Taking a cab home at 2 am after a night of drinking with friends? The reality is that the types of fun you can have dwindle as you age. Going to Spain at 58 is not the same as going at 28.

A final thought I had was that life is meant to be a party, a celebration. And at this party, who is the most interesting person to talk to: The guy explaining his 30 year process of accumulating 10 million in his bank account or the guy talking about his experience riding four wheelers amid ancient ruins on a Greek island?

That's because since the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) aggressive policies distorted local assets to the point of causing negative rates and no incentive to invest in bonds both domestic retail and institutional investors massively invested abroad. At the same time, differences in interest rates between Japan and the rest of the world fueled the so called carry trades, essentially borrowing money in Japan at very low interest rates then convert this money into another currency and invest it in high quality sovereign bonds at nice rates. At the end of the day you have a leveraged position in a high quality investment.  Of course this trade has a currency risk (if yen appreciates then you are screwed) but the BOJ has been consistently buying and selling foreign currencies in order to maintain the Yen quite stable. 

  
We all know interest rates are cool until central banks see serious side effects like high and persistent inflation, well the thing is Japan is suffering its highest inflation rate in 30 years and core consumer prices is twice as much as the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) target level (approx 4% vs 2% target) and with increasing prices in raw materials and some goods Japan needs to import its difficult to think inflation will cool down by itself. 

Despite Japan has a low interest rate compared with the rest of developed economies they face a high risk because of this inflation. The yen is currently in a depreciation spiral, which is a consequence of the BOJ’s aggressive actions to halt yields from rising because the most indebted developed state in the world cant afford higher interest rates. In other words, they can protect the yen or interest rates but not both, as the yen depreciates, inflation increases and the Japanese central bank must do even more QE to keep interest rates in check. They cant allow inflation to get out of control like in the US, because the system is so fragile it wont resist.  

A slight change in Japan's economic policy in the next years is expected by many analysts. 

  
**SUMMARY**

Japan’s policies of the last 30 years fueled a massive demand for global assets (mostly sovereign bonds). Japan may be forced to shift monetary policy in the near future because of inflation (among many other economic problems that exceed this post), if this happens the demand of said sovereign bonds will plummet causing a massive liquidity problems. This affects your investments because lower demand for sovereign debt hurts the ability of governments to stimulate the economy like they did in the last decades. "|0.49|0.0|0.0|0.0

I'm feeling behind for my age so I adjusted my contributions. Increasing from $314 every two weeks to $625. My employer matches 50% up to my first 8% contributed so I have been getting full matching.

t3_14566ek|1686319496.0|investing|Multiple brokerage accounts?|"I started investing in 2018. My parents connected me with a family friend who is an financial advisor at EJ. Unfortunately, I did not do my research and just went with their suggestion. I think at the time I was overwhelmed and just wanted to put leftover cash to work but not really have to think about it. 

While I like my advisor personally, I am frustrated by his work. 

1) He is very stubborn about EJ's risk tolerance corridors. I received a small windfall from my grandfather passing, much of which was in blue chip securities. He's been very aggressive about selling these securities to get the portfolio to EJ's preferred balance given my risk tolerance, leaving me with unnecessarily large capital gains exposure (A couple of these stocks were purchased in the 80s!)

2) He's demonstrated unusual ignorance about pretty basic concepts. For example, we were reviewing my personal budget following a salary increase and he didn't understand marginal tax brackets. 

3) Most importantly, the performance of my portfolio is subpar. It is definitely a more balanced portfolio, yet I seemed to catch the worst of 2022, without the massive upside of '20, '21' and positive start of '23. 

2019: +18%

2021: + 11%

2022: -17%

2023: +5%

Due to all these reasons, I am considering starting a self-managed new brokerage account (open to suggestions) focused largely on index funds. Fortunately, my EJ advisor is in his mid 60s and likely retiring soon. When he does, I will move over my funds to the new brokerage. 

Am I overreacting to the performance of my portfolio? Is it a bad idea to start a second brokerage account?"|0.5|0.0|0.0|0.0

👉 ECB meeting next week  
👉 Here's a chronological summary of every ECB speaker's comments since their last meeting in May  
👉 A PDF version will be available on the weekend (see links in bio)  
👉 Here we go...

**Schnabel  (Neutral)  2023-6-7 T-2:** We have more ground to cover on rates, will depend on data how much more rates will have to increase, we need to see convincing evidence that inflation returns to our 2% target in a sustained and timely manner, a peak in underlying inflration would not be enough to declare victory, the impact of our policy on inflation is expected to peak in 2024, there is great uncertainty over the strength and speed of this process.

**Knot  (Hawk)  2023-6-7 T-2:** The outlook for policy rates after July is unclear, will become more data-dependent after rate hikes in June and July, should not hesitate to keep raising rates if inflation stays high, peak interest rates will have to be maintained for a long time to keep inflation in check, upward risks to inflation are expected to dominate in years to come, prolonged tightening might still lead to stress in financial markets, inflation expectations in markets seem optimistic.

**Makhlouf  (n/a)  2023-6-7 T-2:** Once we've reached a peak on rates they are likely to stay there for a while, not going to say how long that will be, rate hikes beyond summer would be a question of judgement, I'd be interested how the people pricing rate cuts by the end of the year are coming to that conclusion.

**Knot  (Hawk)  2023-6-6 T-3:** Will keep tightening policy until we see inflation returning to 2% but this must be done step-by-step, inflation is still way too high but the worst is behind us, seeing first signs that policy tightening is being transmitted to the real economy.

**Nagel  (Hawk)  2023-6-5 T-4:** Several more rate hikes are still necessary, not certain rates will peak this summer, rates must be held until there is no doubt inflation is returning to 2% in the near term, underlying price pressures remain far too high and show little signs of abating, cautiously optimistic about German growth prospects over the rest of the year.

**Lagarde  (Dove)  2023-6-5 T-4:** No clear evidence that underlying inflation has peaked, price pressures remain strong, our rate hikes are being transmitted forcefully to financing conditions, full effects of our monetary policy measures are starting to materialize, it is very likely we will stop all reinvestments in APP.

**Vujcic  (n/a)  2023-6-5 T-4:** Inflation risks are tilted to the upside, wage pressures are still very lively.

**Makhlouf  (n/a)  2023-6-2 T-7:** Likely to see another rate hike at the next meeting, beyond probable hikes in June and July the picture is a lot less clear, inflation fall is very welcome but not definitive and underlying pressures are still quite strong.

**Panetta  (n/a)  2023-6-2 T-7:** We have not reached the end of the rate hike cycle but we aren't far away from it, inflation is too high but there is no reason to worry, now is not the time to be too hasty raising rates, the debate will soon shift from level of interest rates to that of maintaining them over time, cannot rule out a technical recession in the Eurozone, committed to getting inflation back to 2% target.

**Vasle  (n/a)  2023-6-2 T-7:** More rate hikes needed to get inflation to 2% target, core inflation remains high and persistent.

**Rehn  (Neutral)  2023-6-1 T-8:** The monetary policy journey is not over yet, core inflation must slow before mulling easing, the inflation outlook continues to be too high for too long, a lasting rise in inflation expectations is an upside risk to inflation, the lags and the strength of policy transmission to the real economy remain uncertain.

**Villeroy  (Neutral)  2023-6-1 T-8:** Upcoming rate hikes will be marginal, rate hikes are beginning to have an impact on inflation, we will bring inflation back to 2% by 2025.

**Kazaks  (Hawk)  2023-6-1 T-8:** It is hard to say where interest rates will peak but rates will stay at their peak for a while.

**De Guindos  (Dove)  2023-6-1 T-8:** A big part of our journey to raise rates has been done but there is still some way to go, recent inflation data are positive but still far from target.

**Lagarde  (Dove)  2023-6-1 T-8:** We need to continue with rate hikes until we are sufficiently confident that inflation is on track to return to 2% in a timely manner, we cannot say that we are satisfied with the inflation outlook, a period of catch-up wage growth need not cause unduly persistent inflation over time, rate hikes are already feeding forcefully into bank lending conditions.

**Villeroy  (Neutral)  2023-5-31 T-9:** It is quite likely that inflation has passed its peak in France, perseverance counts for more than speed regarding monetary policy, will bring inflation down to 2% between now and 2025, markets are absorbing QT smoothly and positively.

**Müller  (Hawk)  2023-5-31 T-9:** Very likely that we will hike by 25 bps more than once, probably too optimistic to see rate cuts in early 2024, core inflation shows no signs of slowing yet.

**De Guindos  (Dove)  2023-5-31 T-9:** Inflation data today and yesterday has been positive, victory over inflation is not there yet but the trajectory is correct.

**Visco  (Dove)  2023-5-31 T-9:** Must proceed with the correct degree of graduality now that rates are in restrictive territory, longer-term inflation expectations remain in line with the definition of price stability.

**Centeno  (n/a)  2023-5-31 T-9:** Spain's CPI reading shows that Europe's inflation is easing, doesn't see a risk of monetary policy overshooting, reversal of supply shock should slow inflation.

**Simkus  (Hawk)  2023-5-30 T-10:** Expects a 25 bps rate hike in June and July, September is too early to say.

**De Cos  (Dove)  2023-5-29 T-11:** Policy tightening is well underway but based on the information currently available to us we have some way to go, interest rates will have to remain in restrictive territory for an extended period of time.

**Wunsch  (Neutral)  2023-5-27 T-13:** We hiked 400 bps and we might have to do more, we have more ground to cover, real rates are still quite low, if fiscal policy remains supportive then monetary policy will have to do more to get inflation under control.

**Lane  (n/a)  2023-5-26 T-14:** The ECB shouldn't predict where rate hikes will end, no sense of certainty on the terminal rate, uncertainty in inflation dynamics is high, food inflation will reverse later this year, energy price fall will feed into core prices but timeframe is uncertain, there is some upside risks to wage growth.

**Makhlouf  (n/a)  2023-5-26 T-14:** My lead option is to hike rates in June and July, open about subsequent decisions, haven't seen wage settlements that raise concerns on a Eurozone level, very relaxed about market pricing of rates.

**Vujcic  (n/a)  2023-5-26 T-14:** It is questionable if we will be able to get to 2% inflation in the next two years, inflation momentum is still persistent.

**Villeroy  (Neutral)  2023-5-25 T-15:** Rates should peak in the next three meetings, rates are clearly in restrictive territory, we have completed most of the rate hike journey, monitoring the passthrough of ""massive"" past rate hikes.

**Knot  (Hawk)  2023-5-25 T-15:** We need at least two more rate hikes, both should be 25 bps each, totally open-minded on what happens with rates after summer, should stay put for a significant period of time, market pricing of rate cuts is overly optimistic, headline inflation peak behind us but not sure if at peak of underlying inflation, most of the impact of the ECB's tightening is still in the pipeline.

**De Guindos  (Dove)  2023-5-25 T-15:** Wages pose upside risk to inflation outlook, fiscal policy is an important factor for inflation, governments should roll back related support measures as the energy crisis fades, banking tensions add to downside inflation risks.

**Panetta  (n/a)  2023-5-24 T-16:** The GC is to decide in October whether to launch preparation phase to develop and test a digital Euro, the ECB would issue a digital Euro but not distribute it.

**Nagel  (Hawk)  2023-5-23 T-17:** Several more rate hikes are needed to tame inflation, will need to maintain peak rate for a sufficiently long time until inflation has fallen sustainably.

**De Guindos  (Dove)  2023-5-23 T-17:** The non-bank financial sector remains particularly exposed to asset price corrections and credit risk should corporate sector fundamentals deteriorate substantially, more concerned about conflict between monetary and fiscal policy than about financial instability.

**Lagarde  (Dove)  2023-5-23 T-17:** Rate are yet to reach sufficiently restrictive levels, rates are to stay restrictive as long as necessary.

**Villeroy  (Neutral)  2023-5-22 T-18:** The primary question today is not how much further to hike rates but how large the pass-through is of what is already in the pipe, expects that we will be at the terminal rate not later than September, how long we maintain rates is now more important than the precise terminal level, we can hike or pause at the next three meetings, in the current tightening cycle the lag in policy transmission may be at the upper end of 1-2 year range.

**De Cos  (Dove)  2023-5-22 T-18:** The ECB still has some way to go to tight monetary policy, interest rates will have to remain in restrictive territory for extended periods to achieve inflation goal.

**Lane  (n/a)  2023-5-22 T-18:** The markets believe that inflation will come back to 2% in the foreseeable future.

**Lagarde  (Dove)  2023-5-21 T-19:** We are not done yet, we are not pausing based on the information I have today, the inflation outlook is too high for too long, we have covered a large chunk of the journey towards taming inflation and bringing it back to our target, so many things can go wrong that we cannot give forward guidance.

**Schnabel  (Neutral)  2023-5-19 T-21:** The ECB can continue to do whatever is needed to bring inflation back to 2% in a timely manner, wage growth has picked up substantially and as a result there are concerns about second-round effects on inflation, financial stability is a precondition for price stability and vice versa, we have a clear mandate of price stability, inflation expectations are stubbornly high, it seems fiscal policy is too expansionary.

**Lagarde  (Dove)  2023-5-19 T-21:** ECB will be courageous to take needed decisions to bring inflation back to 2%, we are heading towards more delicate decisions going forward, we should not trade off price stability and financial stability, will do whatever is necessary to deliver price stability.

**De Guindos  (Dove)  2023-5-18 T-22:** There is still scope to keep raising rates but most of the tightening has already been done, does not know what the end point is going to be.

**Rehn  (Neutral)  2023-5-17 T-23:** Need to see core CPI slow substantially.

**De Cos  (Dove)  2023-5-17 T-23:** The ECB is getting near the end of its tightening cycle, transmission of monetary policy remains strong.

**De Guindos  (Dove)  2023-5-17 T-23:** Concerns are mounting about the outlook for commercial real estate loans, Eurozone banks may benefit less from higher rates than expected.

**Holzmann  (Hawk)  2023-5-16 T-24:** We need to go beyond a 4% interest rate to fight inflation, would have preferred a 50 bps hike at the May meeting, core inflation is unlikely to slow much more this year, hikes above 25 bps are probably not possible now, we shouldn't pause hikes until we reach 4%.

**Makhlouf  (n/a)  2023-5-16 T-24:** We have lost a degree of trust, that affects what we should be doing with our decision making, we should do more in terms of thinking about the audience we're talking to.

**De Guindos  (Dove)  2023-5-14 T-26:** We have now entered the home stretch of our monetary policy tightening path, we are returning to normalcy with 25 bps steps.

**Kazimir  (n/a)  2023-5-14 T-26:** The ECB may need to keep raising rates longer than previously thought, convinced there are more meetings ahead where we will decide on raising rates, would also be satisfied with a 50 bps hike but 25 bps is a return to normal, the key point is that core inflation is still creeping up and that's proof we haven't solved the problem yet.

**Nagel  (Hawk)  2023-5-12 T-28:** Latest rate hike won't be the last, inflation is still too high and too strong, need to be sure that the inflation wave ends.

**Nagel  (Hawk)  2023-5-11 T-29:** Meeting-by-meeting approach is the right path for the ECB, nothing is off the table for the September meeting, moving closer to restrictive territory but not there yet, need at least a year-and-a-half to see core inflation closer to 2%.

**De Cos  (Dove)  2023-5-11 T-29:** We are now closer to the final cycle of rate hikes.

**De Guindos  (Dove)  2023-5-11 T-29:** There can be more rate hikes, how many depends on the data, rate decision had a very high consensus, don't believe anybody who names a terminal rate, markets can be wrong about terminal rates, inflation will undoubtedly fall, worried about core inflation and services, underlying inflation will fall too, we have to assess the impact of interest rate hikes on financing conditions.

**Villeroy  (Neutral)  2023-5-10 T-30:** We have travelled most of the way on rate hikes, what's still lying ahead is ""more marginal"", it is the future impact of past rate hikes that should for the most part allow us to reach out objective within two years.

**Nagel  (Hawk)  2023-5-10 T-30:** We are not done hiking yet, approaching the final stretch of rate hikes, still work to be done on core inflation, we are holding the course on monetary policy.

**Lagarde  (Dove)  2023-5-10 T-30:** We still have more ground to cover in the fight against inflation, have to move in a very deliberate and decisive way, there are factors that can induce significant upside risks to the inflation outlook, have to be extremely attentive to potential risks and particularly wage increases.

**Centeno  (n/a)  2023-5-10 T-30:** ECB rates to remain high for some time after rate peak, rates should start to come down some time in 2024, interest rate adjustment is still underway.

**Sources  (n/a)  2023-5-10 T-30:** Bloomberg: some ECB members are saying a September hike may be needed.

**Stournas  (n/a)  2023-5-10 T-30:** Barring any drastic changes rate hikes will be over this year, we are close to the end of the tightening cycle, cannot say how many more rate hikes are still needed, may possibly return to very low rates again but don't know that yet.

**Schnabel  (Neutral)  2023-5-9 T-31:** No doubt that we will have to do more on inflation, rate cuts are highly unlikely for the foreseeable future.

**Kazaks  (Hawk)  2023-5-9 T-31:** Rate-hiking may not be finished in July, doing too little remains the greater danger, bet on spring 2024 rate cuts is ""significantly premature"", not impossible for the ECB to hike or pause as the Fed cuts.

**Nagel  (Hawk)  2023-5-9 T-31:** Interest rates should rise further, could have imagined a 50 bps hike at the last meeting but is okay with the 25 bps, the market is not always right about the ECB terminal rate.

**Kazimir  (n/a)  2023-5-9 T-31:** Slowing hikes lets the ECB go higher for longer, there's plenty of ground to cover, according to available statistics the ECB will need to maintain raising rates for longer than expected, projections point to September as the earliest time to judge the effectiveness of measures and if inflation is moving towards the target.

**Vasle  (n/a)  2023-5-9 T-31:** Inflation is becoming increasingly stubborn, our job on inflation is not yet complete, we need to see a change in core inflation, more rate hikes will be required, avoiding a recession is possible.

**Vujcic  (n/a)  2023-5-9 T-31:** More rate hikes will be required to return inflation to target.

**Knot  (Hawk)  2023-5-8 T-32:** Rate hikes are starting to have an impact but more will be needed, policy works with a certain delay so the biggest effects of what we've done so far are still in the pipeline, supported last week's 25 bps hike, could support further hikes above 5% if needed.

**Lane  (n/a)  2023-5-8 T-32:** There is still a lot of momentum in food and core inflation.

**Villeroy  (Neutral)  2023-5-5 T-35:** Favours smaller rate hikes, change in rate increase rhythm is an important signal, there will likely be several more hikes but we have done the essential, our goal is to win the fight against inflation without triggering a recession.

**Müller  (Hawk)  2023-5-5 T-35:** It is prudent to allow previous hikes to make an impact.

**Simkus  (Hawk)  2023-5-5 T-35:** Interest rates are not high enough and will need to be raised further, we will keep rates high for a sufficiently long time to get inflation back to 2%.

**Visco  (Dove)  2023-5-5 T-35:** The peak of ECB interest rates may not be too far off, market's view of the terminal rate is ""an important reference point"" for the ECB, policy can only be moving towards higher rates, must proceed with caution, policy is being transmitted into the economy in an ""energetic"" way.

**Lagarde  (Dove)  2023-5-4 T-36:** We know that we have more ground to cover, 25 bps hike had almost unanimous support, some suggested 50 bps and some said 25 bps but no one said no change, not making any commitment to rate cuts at any point, this is not a pause, very strong consensus around the path we chose, we are continuing the hiking process, this is a journey and we have not arrived yet, will continue to follow a data-dependent approach, reports from corporates regarding borrowing suggest that rates are restrictive, corporate demand for bank loans was ""really, really down"", price pressures remain strong, incoming information broadly supports medium-term outlook formed at the previous meeting, private domestic demand and consumption likely to remain weak, no longer says growth risks are to the downside.

**Sources  (n/a)  2023-5-4 T-36:** Reuters: Some ECB policymakers see 2-3 rate hikes ahead, Holzmann was the lone holdout but didn't have a vote at the meeting, policymakers reached a deal on smaller hike in return for guidance for more hikes ahead and an APP wind down, policymakers don't see the need to sell APP bonds."|0.46|0.0|0.0|0.0

My journey with investing has been pretty up and down, I used to just invest randomly in companies who's names I recognised and perceived well. I didn't do anything in terms of risk management or even think about questions like how much of my capital to invest in a single position etc. 

Since then I've read about portfolio theory, looked at risk management and the efficient frontier, looked at monte carlo simulations, read about PE ratio TEVBIT etc and looked at tools to track those. I also use tools for tracking my portfolio, as I find the brokers themselves don't give enough of the kind of information I want... stuff like exposure, returns compared to the market, my risk level etc.

Following the advice from a financial advisor, I started a Treasury Bill ladder with about $150k, by investing in Treasury Bills in three months increments at $50k each.

The concept of a Treasury Bill makes sense to me. Buying at a discount to then receive the face value of the product at the end of the term.

However, I do have a little confusion... If I buy a three month Treasury Bill (13 weeks) with $50k, and let's say the difference between the face value and the purchase value is $3k. And I also buy a 52-week TBill for the same amount, would I only be reaping $3k over the course of the year?

I guess my main question is... How do these pay out and is there any advantage in longer term TBills?

t3_144f0wm|1686244337.0|investing|Seeking input on your experiences with Annuities|"I have about $950k in Jackson annuities, these are within an IRA and income producing annuities and very high fees.  They will pay 4% of the Total value starting when I'm 60.  My advisor at the time suggested we invest in these years ago.  Speaking with a different advisor today, he is suggesting that the advisor should have never suggested these long term income producing annuities at such as young age (mid 30's at the time).  He said that there are other options (including some newer annuities with downside protection and no fees which I find hard to believe).  

I'm looking to move these annuities to something different.  My advisor recommended the Equitable - SCS Plus 21 B series which is a 6 year annuity with a 20% downside buffer and a 500% upside cap.  It invests only in the S&amp;P 500 and has 0 fees.

Pros:  
\-20% downside Protection so if the S and P goes down to 25%, I will only be down 5%.  If it goes up 200%, I would keep the 200%  
\-Sleep well at night knowing that I have downside protection  
\-0 fees.  I dug in on this one hard.  No fees of any kind (unsure how, but seems to be the case)

Cons:  
\-500% cap over 6 years (But, I can't imagine the S and P doing over 500% in 6 years)  
\-No dividends.  I'm not sure exactly how big of deal this is, but I understand that I will not get any dividends if I go with the annuity

So  - Would love to hear your experiences with anything similar and thoughts on whether I'm missing something big here?"|0.57|2.0|0.0|2.0

👉 Here's a chronological summary of every Fed speaker's comments since their last meeting in May

👉 A PDF version that's a bit easier to read is available here: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PGon9bG10ow1hsziTNhOe7iHsS-Q7Y8w/view?usp=sharing)

👉 Here we go...  


**Harker (Neutral) 2023-6-1 T-7:** My preference is for skipping a rate hike, it's prudent to skip a rate hike in June, let's skip and see how it goes, we are close to the place where we can hold rates in place, sees promising signs that the Fed's rate hikes are working, disinflation is disappointingly slow, if inflation started coming down unexpectedly fast then we could cut rates but that is not my forecast, sees 2023 GDP growth below 1% and unemployment at 4.4%, expects inflation to fall to around 3.5% this year and 2.5% next year with 2% in 2025.

**Bullard (Hawk) 2023-6-1 T-7:** Rates are at the low end of what is arguably sufficiently restrictive, monetary policy landscape in much better shape today with the FFR at a more appropriate level than it was a year ago.

**Bowman (Neutral) 2023-5-31 T-8:** Residential real estate appears to be rebounding with implications for the Fed's inflation battle, while lower rents will eventually be reflected in inflation data home prices themselves are levelling out.

**Collins (Neutral) 2023-5-31 T-8:** Inflation is simply too high, the Fed is intent on reducing inflation.

**Harker (Neutral) 2023-5-31 T-8:** I am in the camp that we can skip a meeting, it would be a skip and not a pause, a pause says you may hold there for a while and I don't know that we're ready for that yet, data still to come may change my mind, need some slowing in the labour market, the economy keeps chugging along, not seeing much of a credit crunch after SVB.

**Jefferson (Neutral) 2023-5-31 T-8:** Skipping a rate increase at the coming meeting would allow us to see more data before deciding on the extent of additional tightening, holding rates constant should not be taken to mean rates have reached a peak for this tightening cycle, inflation remains too high but some measures have been slowing, monetary policy works with a lag and a year is not long enough to feel the full effect, base case outlook is not for a recession.

**Mester (Hawk) 2023-5-31 T-8:** No compelling reason to wait on rate hikes, more of a compelling case for bringing rates up and then holding for a while, decision could still be swayed by NFP and the next inflation report.

**Barkin (Neutral) 2023-5-30 T-9:** There is uncertainty around where rates need to go, it would be shocking if rates fell again to zero in a future recession, hopes that rates can stat at a ""neutral, normal"" level for some time, seeing evidence that rate hikes are curbing demand, CRE strain appears focused in B and C quality office buildings in downtown areas and not the entire sector.

**Goolsbee (Neutral) 2023-5-28 T-11:** Trying to make it a point not to prejudge and make decision when we're still weeks out from the next FOMC meeting, we are going to get a lot of important data between now and then.

**Mester (Hawk) 2023-5-26 T-13:** Everything is on the table for June, still more data to see ahead of the June meeting, doesn't know exactly how tight monetary policy is right now, does think they will have to tighten ""a bit more"", important not to under-tighten, the Fed has made slow progress on inflation and that's concerning, may have to revise up her inflation projections in the June SEP, hasn't seen much sign that banking stress is affecting credit conditions.

**Barkin (Neutral) 2023-5-25 T-14:** Demand is definitely cooling in part because it was overstimulated during the pandemic, rate hikes are also helping to reduce demand, some businesses are still saying they need to raise prices, the labour market is quite tight.

**Collins (Neutral) 2023-5-25 T-14:** The Fed may be at or near a time to pause rate hikes, a pause would give the Fed space to measure impact, inflation is too high but there are promising signs of moderation, banking sector likely to weigh on demand.

**Bostic (Neutral) 2023-5-24 T-15:** Best case scenario is the Fed will not consider a rate cut well into 2024, will base rate decisions on data, does not want to be locked into a pre-determined path, expects to see stress in the jobs market when inflation is falling towards the target.

**Waller (Hawk) 2023-5-24 T-15:** Does not expect data in the next couple of months to make it clear the terminal interest rate has been reached, does not support stopping hikes unless there is clear evidence that inflation is moving down to 2% target, prudent risk management may suggest skipping a hike in June and leaning towards July, need to maintain flexibility for June meeting, concerned about the lack of progress on inflation, a rebound in housing market is raising questions about how sustained lower rent increases will be, doesn't like that we have MBS on the balance sheet, there are good yield curve inversions and that may be what we have now, a good inversion is when it suggests inflation will come down.

**Logan (Neutral) 2023-5-23 T-16:** Backstop should be available whenever banks need it including nights, weekends or holidays.

**Barkin (Neutral) 2023-5-22 T-17:** Will not prejudge June meeting outcome, still looking to be convinced inflation is in a steady decline, the Fed would have to think hard about the design of a CBDC if Congress did authorize it.

**Bostic (Neutral) 2023-5-22 T-17:** Comfortable waiting a little bit to see how the economy plays out, will take decisions one meeting at a time and let things play out.

**Daly (Neutral) 2023-5-22 T-17:** Prudent to refrain from commenting on Fed policy action, declined to say what the Fed should do at the June meeting, wants to see if policy tightening is affecting the economy, still a lot of data before June meeting, tighter credit conditions may be like 1-2 rate hikes, would be historical anomaly to get 2% inflation with sub-4% unemployment, seems reasonable to see unemployment to go above 4%.

**Bullard (Hawk) 2023-5-22 T-17:** The Fed will have to go higher this year by perhaps 50 bps, the September dot plot was based on slow growth and inflation improvements that have not occurred, core measures of inflation have not changed much in recent months, the Fed should err on the side of doing more, recession arguments are overstated, base case remains relatively slow growth for the rest of the year and into 2024.

**Kashkari (Hawk) 2023-5-22 T-17:** It's a close call whether to raise or pause in June, it may be that we have to go north of 6% but that isn't clear yet, not seeing evidence that banking stress is doing the Fed's job on inflation, services inflation seems ""pretty darn entrenched"", it is way too early to declare the all clear on banking problems.

**Kashkari (Hawk) 2023-5-21 T-18:** Open to the idea of moving a little bit more slowly on rate hikes, would object to any kind of declaration that we're done, if the committee chooses to skip a meeting to get more information that could make sense, a skip to get more information is very different than saying we're done.

**Powell (Neutral) 2023-5-19 T-20:** Has not made any decision on whether rates are sufficiently restrictive, the risks of doing too much or too little are becoming more balanced, we haven't made any decisions yet about the extent to which additional policy firming will be appropriate, inflation is far above the Fed's objective, we are strongly committed to returning to 2% goal, policy rate may not have to rise as far as otherwise due to tightening bank credit conditions, positive supply shocks during globalization probably did help keep inflation low but are unlikely to be repeated, the banking system is strong and resilient, our guidance today is limited to factors that go into policy decision.

**Williams (Neutral) 2023-5-19 T-20:** New work has shown even with pandemic the natural interest rate remains low, pandemic impact on the natural rate has proven modest.

**Barr (Neutral) 2023-5-18 T-21:** No inherent conflict between monetary policy and supervision by the Fed.

**Collins (Neutral) 2023-5-18 T-21:** Falling minority unemployment rates are promising for the economy.

**Jefferson (Neutral) 2023-5-18 T-21:** A year is not long enough to feel the full effect of interest rate hikes so far, inflation is too high, growth has slowed considerably but outlook is not for a recession, evidence so far points to only a modest incremental tightening of credit conditions to recent bank stress, uncertain how tighter credit will influence household and business spending.

**Logan (Neutral) 2023-5-18 T-21:** Data at this time does not support skipping a rate hike at the June meeting, incoming data could yet show that it is appropriate to skip a meeting, it is a long way from here to 2% inflation, concerned about whether inflation is falling fast enough, recognizes arguments against tightening policy too much or too fast, effect of banking stress is comparable to a 25-50 bps rate increase.

**Bullard (Hawk) 2023-5-18 T-21:** Leaning towards a June hike but keeping an open mind, higher rates are insurance against inflation, rates are at the low end of sufficiently restrictive with the top seen above 6%, better and more prudent to be in the middle of the zone, fall in treasury yields is offsetting banking sector tightening.

**Barkin (Neutral) 2023-5-16 T-23:** I like the optionality implied in the statement, comfortable with more hikes if this is what's needed, businesses are reluctant to let staff go, deposit flows are stable at the banks in my district, the number one lesson from the 1970s is don't quit too soon.

**Barr (Neutral) 2023-5-16 T-23:** We are carefully looking at commercial real estate risk.

**Bostic (Neutral) 2023-5-16 T-23:** Still some way to go until inflation is beaten, wages didn't fully catch up to inflation in 2022.

**Goolsbee (Neutral) 2023-5-16 T-23:** Has not decided anything for the June meeting, would be a mistake to commit to a rate move when more data is coming, not sure if we've put enough restraint on the economy yet, far too premature to be talking about rate cuts, starting to see some slowing in activity, there's still some potential for a soft landing, wages are not a leading indicator of inflation.

**Logan (Neutral) 2023-5-16 T-23:** Central banks should review post-GFC stress episodes, may need to travel more slowly when conditions are uncertain, gradual policy adjustments can be helpful in mitigating financial stability risks.

**Williams (Neutral) 2023-5-16 T-23:** Inflation is gradually moving in the right direction, it does take a while to feel the impact of policy, current banking situation is nothing like the 2008 banking crisis, the banking system is sound and resilient.

**Mester (Hawk) 2023-5-16 T-23:** I don't think we're at a hold rate yet, would like policy rate to get to a point where it could equally be a potential increase or decrease, I don't put it in terms of a pause but instead a hold, rate are not at a sufficiently restrictive level.

**Barkin (Neutral) 2023-5-15 T-24:** Not giving a June meeting decision because there is still data to come and because of the uncertainty around the debt ceiling, very comfortable with a data-dependent approach but not yet convinced that inflation is on a steady path lower, sees no barrier to higher rates if inflation persists, demand may need to cool even more for inflation to reach the 2% target, policymakers should be sensitive to financial stability risks but that should not take precedence over the fight against inflation.

**Barr (Neutral) 2023-5-15 T-24:** The US banking system remains sound and resilient, all deposits in the banking system are safe.

**Bostic (Neutral) 2023-5-15 T-24:** If I was voting now I would hold rates in June, we may have to go up further on rates, have to keep a possible rate hike on the table, rate cuts are not part of his baseline, appropriate policy is to wait and see the effects of tightening, does not see inflation coming down quickly, the math on inflation and the economy will work in the Fed's favour in the months ahead, there is still a long way to go in the battle against inflation, expects inflation to be in the high 3s at year-end, there is some risk of a recession but if we fall into one it will not be long or deep.

**Goolsbee (Neutral) 2023-5-15 T-24:** There is still a lot of impact from prior hikes that's still to come, his vote to hike at the last meeting was a ""close call"", inflation is improving but not that rapidly, the effect of banking stress isn't small and we need to take it into account.

**Kashkari (Hawk) 2023-5-15 T-24:** The Fed has more work to do, we should not be fooled by a few months of good data, inflation is much too high but starting to come down.

**Jefferson (Neutral) 2023-5-14 T-25:** Inflation is still high, little progress on core inflation is bad news, the full impact of the Fed's rapid rate hikes is likely stell ahead, disinflation has been slower and more uneven than the Fed would hive liked, the uncertainty around the effect of bank stress and credit shock could be larger than expected.

**Bullard (Hawk) 2023-5-14 T-25:** Market-based inflation expectations are back down to levels consistent with the 2% inflation target, policy is not at the low end of sufficiently restrictive.

**Bowman (Neutral) 2023-5-12 T-27:** Additional rate hikes are ""likely appropriate"" if inflation stays high and the labour market stays tight, policy rate will need to remain sufficiently restrictive for some time, uncertain if it is already sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down, policy action is not on a pre-set course, recent data have not provided consistent evidence that inflation is on a downward path.

**Goolsbee (Neutral) 2023-5-12 T-27:** Inflation is too high but at least it's coming down, hopes inflation can ease without a recession.

**Kashkari (Hawk) 2023-5-11 T-28:** Tight monetary policy may be needed for ""extended time"", inflation has come down but is still above target, bank turmoil can be a source of slowing for the economy, it is conceivable that once we get inflation down to 2% we could have a conversation about changing the target, if markets are right and inflation will fall quickly one would imagine rates could normalize, if high inflation is more embedded then rates will need to stay higher for longer, I am now on the more hawkish end of Fed policy spectrum, we will be back in a low inflation and low rate environment once this period of high inflation ends.

**Waller (Hawk) 2023-5-11 T-28:** Climate change does not pose a serious risk to large banks or to US financial stability, it is not the Fed's job to be a climate policymaker, the issue is not whether climate poses risks from acute events like severe weather but if those are distinct from other possible shocks, transition to lower-carbon economy likely to be gradual and predictable and not pose risks to banks.

**Barkin (Neutral) 2023-5-10 T-29:** The Fed's message last week was ""explicitly not a pause"" on rates or ""even necessarily a peak"" but provides the optionality to do more if needed and the option to wait if waiting is appropriate.

**Jefferson (Neutral) 2023-5-9 T-30:** Inflation has come down and the economy has started to slow in an orderly fashion, banks have started to raise lending standards.

**Williams (Neutral) 2023-5-9 T-30:** The Fed hasn't said it's done raising rates, does not see any reason to cut rates this year, will raise rates if needed, the Fed needs to be data-dependent, tighter credit may blunt how far the Fed goes with rate hikes, does not see tighter credit knocking the economy totally off course, acute phase of bank stress is over, not seeing a wage-price spiral, confident that the Fed is on the right path to lower inflation to 2% target, core services ex housing inflation still shows persistent inflation.

**Goolsbee (Neutral) 2023-5-8 T-31:** Too early to make a call on rates for June meeting, getting vibes that a credit squeeze is beginning, must be data-dependent and watch credit conditions, weighing how much Fed work is being done by tighter credit, recession is a possibility.

**Goolsbee (Neutral) 2023-5-5 T-34:** Way too premature to expect a June rate hike, we know that credit conditions like the ones we are seeing now in the past have been correlated with recessions and credit crunches, bank situation has to give you some pause.

**Bullard (Hawk) 2023-5-5 T-34:** Quarter-point hike this week was a good step, this puts the Fed above 5% but there's a lot of inflation in the economy, ready to be data-dependent with an ""open mind"" on whether to pause or hike at the June meeting, policy is at the ""low end"" of restrictive zone and it's not clear enough for a downward path of inflation, should not have a recession as a base case, the base case is slow growth and declining inflation, labour market is very tight and will take time to cool, sense is that regional banks will do just fine, ultimate impact of bank stress on the economy will be small, we can achieve a soft landing.

**Powell (Neutral) 2023-5-3 T-36:** Prepared to do more if warranted, it is a meaningful change to no longer say we anticipate more firming of policy, real rates are around 2% so policy is tight, we're possibly at a sufficiently restrictive level or not far off, we think we need to stay at this rate for a while, no decision on pause was made today and we will decide on June in June, we will take a data dependent approach, the extent of effects of credit tightening remain uncertain, we won't have to raise rates quite as high due to banking stresses, future policy actions will depend on how events unfold, reducing inflation likely to require below-trend growth and some softening of jobs market, there are some signs that labour supply and demand are coming back into balance, nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, the US banking system is sound and resilient, committed to learning the right lessons from the banking rout."|0.89|179.0|0.0|179.0

Has been having very good earnings reports the last year yet it’s price has largely been the range of 30-40 for its entire listing history. They’ve been listed  since 2006. It’s current price of $39.30 is the same as it was in 2008….yes 2008! They’ve grown exponentially since then. 

Tomorrow they also list their majority owned subsidiary CSI on the Shanghai exchange to generate extra capital because they’re being heavily outpaced on NASDAQ from other US solar companies such as ENPH, FSLR to name a few. Which I think are already overvalued. How long can this Company remain undervalued? A recent analyst price target was lifted from $55-70 (Roth). Which I think is a much more fair valuation compared to its current price. They also have 3 billion in cash, they do have sign significant debt but a large % is tied to ongoing projects. 

I truly think this stock is fantastic for a value investor, albeit a frustrating one seeing it get ignored for this long. What do you guys/girls think?

Title. Tons of little things I don't like about Schwab's interface and a couple big things I completely hate. Looks like I have a 250-character minimum, so here are some:

* No streaming quotes! Not by default at least. Neither in the ""position details"" view nor in the ticker lookup at the bottom
* ""Refresh"" button is in an inconvenient place. Which I have to click more often because no streaming quotes.
* Don't like the layout of the detail stock quote page AT ALL. In particular, have to scroll down to see earnings/PE/dividend data, while the top of the page has useless junk such as sustainability scores
* Harder to search for specific transactions
* Positions view doesn't allow for day's high and low (important to me, TDA had it)
* In general, less efficient , less compact layout overall 

These are just a few of my complaints. NOTHING about Schwab's platform experience is better to me. Maybe they have customization tools I'm missing but they're not obvious. IBKR is about to gain another client.

I'm not a super-frequent trader at all, usually &lt;10 trades per year, but when I do trade I want it to be efficient and want all the info I need right in front of me.

Today I happened to review my portfolio and I feel that it is hightime I did some rejig in my MF portfolio. One of the large-cap MFs hasn't been performing well (consistently since 2yrs). It was already on my ""monitor hard"" list but I've made up my mind to move away from it. I have also identified a different large-cap MF which I'd like to have instead. Question then, what is the right approach to do this switch ? I can think of 2 distinct approaches, and a 3rd perhaps being the hybrid of the 2.

\- Approach-1: Start a Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) to start divesting on monthly (or even weekly) basis and reinvest the amount in the new MF. Here I could choose to keep the quantum of re-investment same as my monthly investment before (into the particular MF), or I could speed it up by being 2x-3x-5x per month.

\- Approach-2: Make a one-shot, move i.e. divest in first MF and move the entire sum into new MF as lump-sum investment.

In the country where I live, there are tax implications, where-in capital gains accrued over longer period have advantageous taxation, compared to capital gains accrued over short period. Thus the gains from most recent SIP investments would be taxed at higher rates. Given this, I could do the ""lumpsum"" treatment for the part of my investment that qualifies as long-term only.

t3_142jtb0|1686065751.0|investing|RBC Prime-Linked GIC Question|"I am managing some temporary excess liquidity for a business and investing in a cashable GIC is a good option for us.

RBC offers a Prime-Linked GIC, which I understand to be a variable rate linked to whatever happens to RBC prime. As of today, Prime Rate at RBC is 6.70% and the GIC pays 4.25%. Therefore, you can pretty much infer it's as a ""prime minus 2.45%"" variable rate.

But when I was on the phone with RBC Investments, they told me that the rate does not actually follow prime. The rate won't change ""if it moves only a little bit up, like 0.25%"". So I asked, ""is the GIC rate prime minus 2.45% or is it some other factor for calculation?""

Turns out no one can answer this question for me. The person on the phone couldn't find anyone who could answer it either. Then I went looking for terms and conditions and ""fine print"". There is nothing about it on the public website, on the private investment page and you can't find any information before or after purchasing the GIC (so far).

The only thing I can find is this:

&gt;The rate of interest on Interest Rate-Linked GICs is calculated based on a discount from the RBC prime interest rate. The RBC prime interest rate is a reference rate for determining interest rates on Canadian dollar commercial loans in Canada and is subject to change. The RBC prime interest rate can be found at rbcroyalbank.com/rates/prime.html. You may obtain the current interest rate applicable to your Interest Rate-Linked GIC by signing into Online or Mobile Banking, by making inquiries at your local branch, or by calling us at 1-888-903-0419.

I have requested the full legal disclosure and terms and conditions so I can read the fine print, but I'm actually a bit shocked that no one could answer or disclose what the discount rate is and whether or not it too is variable. I'm concerned I can't find out more of what I'm buying prior to buying it. I only need to ""agree"" verbally that I want to purchase a GIC and it's done.

I have asked them to send me the full prospectus or legal terms and conditions. We'll see if they show up.

My friend just started a job with a new company, and I wanted to make sure he is properly preparing himself for retirement. He is in his late 20’s and is now able to really start building his portfolio. His time horizon is roughly 30-35 years, and his effective income tax rate is estimated to be roughly 20% this year (state and federal). During our conversation, I found out that the 401K provider has a financial advisor that they provide as a resource to employee participants of the plan. After asking some probing questions over the course of a 15-minute discussion, I feel like that advice that this so called “professional” gave my friend was not only misguided, it was flat out wrong. The first issue I took was with the investment advise he gave. This advice was not to invest most of the money in stocks right now since we “don’t know what the market is going to do this year” and to hold the money in less volatile investments like government bonds and stable value funds to wait out the uncertainty of the year. I fundamentally disagree with this advice as I subscribe to the belief that you should always be buying regardless of what the market is doing (especially in an automated account like a 401K) and that trying to time the market is a fool’s errand. Am I the crazy one here? The second issue I took was with the type of account the advisor recommended. He told my friend that he should NOT be contributing to a Roth 401K and instead should opt for the traditional pre-tax option. This is the second point that I disagree with. My friend is just starting his career and expects his income to scale up quickly over the coming years. I personally believe that because of his age, time horizon, and relatively low effective income tax rate he should be contributing to a Roth 401K until his effective income tax rate breaks 25%. Again, am I missing something here? And if I’m correct, how did this “expert” give such bad advice?"|0.67|6.0|0.0|6.0

t3_142hs1t|1686061547.0|investing|Hindenburg Research Accuses Tingo Group of being just another Nigerian Prince Scam.|"&gt;We are short Tingo Group Inc (NASDAQ:TIO) because we believe the company is an exceptionally obvious scam with completely fabricated financials. Tingo, headquartered in New Jersey, claims to have several business segments focused on providing mobile phones, food processing and an online food marketplace for farmers primarily located in Nigeria.

Tingo was created and run by ""Dozy"" Mmobuosi who is identified as a ""billionaire"" in the press and even tried to buy the soccer team Sheffield United. Dozy claims have made the first mobile payment app in Nigeria, but Hindenburg claims to have contacted the actual creator of said app who says that's a lie. Dozy further claims to have gotten a PhD in ""Rural advancement"" from a Malaysian University, but Hindenburg claims that said university has no one by that name in their register. Dozy was previously charged with 8 counts of writing hot checks in Nigeria in 2017 but letter settled the case in arbitration.

In 2019, Dozy claimed to have launched “Tingo Airlines” and posted social media messages encouraging customers to “fly with Tingo Airlines today”. Media outlets later uncovered that Tingo had photoshopped its logo onto pictures of airplanes. Dozy later admitted to never owning any actual aircraft.

In April 2023, Tingo’s Co-Chairman wrote a public letter resigning from the firm over many suspicious activities at the firm. Likewise, Tingo’s food division is half a year old, yet yet allegedly does over half a billion dollars in business every three months with fatter profit margins than anyone else making food... Despite having no food processing plant and instead the more dubious claim to be the middleman between ordinary farmers and an unnamed food processor.

Tingo likewise showed photos of a groundbreaking ceremony building a food processing plant, but Hindenburg those were actually stock photos of an oil refinery. Rendering even more dubious Tingo's claim to be building many things at once, and Hindenburg said they found overgrown weeds at the alleged sites. Tingo likewise announced securing 150 million dollars in funding for more building from a bank who said their account balance with them was zero. Likewise, there's an affiliated entity transaction with Tingo Group buying Tingo Foods for the cost of their inventory, but said inventory drops from their balance sheet without explanation, making Hindenburg think it never existed to begin with and the transaction was just to boost valuations.

Allegedly Tingo phone apps are servicing the same farmers that sell them food through two farming cooperatives, but Hindenburg said coops had never heard of Tingo and they had fewer than 100 farmers each. The owner of one co-op said flatly he had no relationship with Tingo who are surely just scammers.

Tingo claimed its mobile handset leasing, call and data segments generated $128 million in revenue last quarter (\~15% of total), claiming these services are provided through an agreement with Airtel in Nigeria. The type of license they claim did not exist until June, 2023.

Our checks with the Nigerian Communications Commission showed it has no record of Tingo being a mobile licensee at all, despite company claims of having 12 million mobile customers.

Despite claiming to have millions of farmers using its phones, Tingo Mobile’s corporate presentation and webpage uses stock photos of farmers using phones.

Hindenburg said the small office of Tingo's they found had notices on it saying the firm was tax delinquent. When Hindenburg tried to enroll in a phone plan they were told that location was not operational yet. Tingo allegedly also has a Ghana section, but there are no records of the firm's existence in Ghana and their email, website, and phone numbers are defunct in that country. Tingo also claimed partnership with a local Nigerian bank, who explicitly and publicly denies any affiliation. Likewise, Tingo's alleged point-of-sale software is simply photos of other people's software with their logo photoshopped onto it.

However, truth becomes stranger than fiction when one realizes Tingo's sales projections exceeds the agricultural exports of Nigeria. And most of their website's links don't work and the testimonials are all fake. Hindenburg further claims they found no records of Tingo goods passing through Nigerian customs. In a classic among scammers, the financial reports have typos, math errors, and a note to itself that the accountant forgot to delete. The firm further claims to have been audited by an Israeli firm, which is strange since they do not claim to do any business in Israel.

Hindenburg believes Tingo Group is worth absolutely nothing. To be fair, this is both a fairly typical and a fairly sophisticated fraud for Nigeria, but the real question is how did this junk ever get listed on the NASDAQ? The answer is first they bought a company listed on an OTC market, and used that company to buy a tiny Chinese company already listed. "|0.94|605.0|0.0|605.0

Some info about her:
She is 67 years old, still working, and not collecting Social Security yet. She realistically probably has several more years of work left, as she works at a grocery store and is paying a mortgage. I believe she will have a pension upon retirement, unsure of its value.

She’s always told me to invest in a Roth IRA; fast forward 15 years to find out while she’s been contributing to hers, she’s only been contributing to the core account and not actually investing it past an initial two investments back in 2004 that a friend helped her do.

She invested $3k in FFFCX, Fidelity Freedom 2010 Fund. She currently has $7k in it, and $53k in cash (FDRXX).

Looking at the chart for FFFCX on Google, from when she invested (2004 to today) it’s showing a -9.23% return but yet she’s up from $3k to $7k, +142%, according to her account. I’m not too familiar with TDFs and bonds, but I know the performance charts typically don’t correlate directly to gains.

Can someone clarify?

Also at a fee of 0.48%, I want to pull her from this and set up a 3 fund basic portfolio. Something like VTI/VXUS/BND.

When a company repurchases stocks, the shareholder equity and asset sections decreases by the same amount (i.e Number of shares * Price at moment of purchase) because the stocks become a treasury stock which is considered contra-equity. So far so good.

It's when the the treasury stocks are issued under stock compensation plans that the whole thing doesn't make sense to me.

I was specifically looking at Adobe Stock FY2017 Shareholder Equity section specifically(Page 57 and 60)
 https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.annualreports.com/HostedData/AnnualReportArchive/a/NASDAQ_ADBE_2017.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjCmOSlnq3_AhWOlP0HHQDRAdIQFnoECA0QAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw0C0BxZbmvuI0K0EHKJUF2P

1) In its YoY  table for Shareholder Equity  it says 2 things contributed to it's APIC: ""Reissuance of Treasury Stock under stock compensation plan"" and ""Stock Based Compensation"". What is the difference between these 2 and why are their APICs so different(Stock based compensation gave 453 million while the other only 1.7 million? Isn't all stock compensated from Treasury stock?

2) In the YoY table the reissuance has a negative effect on retained earnings but the stock based compensation doesn't?

3)We know that when a company repurchases stocks both Assets and Equity goes down equally. However, when a company is issuing stocks as compensation plans to employees, the equity side of the balance sheet goes up(because shares outstanding increases) but does the asset side go up equally as well?

4) Basically, it's the YoY table that I can't make sense of. It's tripping me up.

&gt;The first sign of deep trouble in US banking this year came from a sunbaked office complex in a San Diego suburb. There, a small firm called Silvergate Capital Corp. assured investors it was weathering a run on deposits. Its lifeline: about $4.3 billion from a Federal Home Loan Bank.

&gt;Heads turned across the financial industry.

&gt;Silvergate didn’t have a network of branches serving consumers, and it barely offered mortgages. It specialized in moving dollars for cryptocurrency ventures. 

&gt;Soon it became apparent that a roster of troubled regional banks was leaning on FHLBs — a relic of the Great Depression originally aimed at ensuring financial firms have cash to lend to homebuyers. Yet the banks had little to do with everyday mortgage lending. 

&gt;Silicon Valley Bank, catering to venture capitalists and tech startups, said it held $15 billion from an FHLB at the end of 2022. Signature Bank, with clients including crypto platforms, had $11 billion. And by April,  First Republic Bank, offering mortgages to millionaires on unusually sweet terms, ended up with more than $28 billion. All four banks collapsed.

&gt;For many, that was a crystallizing moment for the 90-year-old Federal Home Loan Bank system, which has ballooned to more than $1.5 trillion while playing a growing role as a backstop for banks taking all kinds of risks — and a diminishing role in funding new mortgages. That’s raising questions about the purpose of FHLBs and why the private institutions enjoy so much government support.

&gt;This look at the system is based on interviews with more than 30 current and former FHLB officials, overseers, borrowers and other market participants, most of them speaking on the condition they not be named to candidly discuss confidential experiences. Many described an environment where loans are made quickly with little due diligence, generating billions of dollars a year in profits for FHLBs and the banks they serve — plus millions of dollars in bonuses and other compensation for their own executives.

&gt;It’s hard to imagine the Federal Reserve rewarding bosses for arranging industry bailouts, but that is in effect what now happens at FHLBs.

&gt;The FHLB of San Francisco, for example, more than doubled its assets last year as Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic and others embarked on their borrowing binges. Its chief executive officer, Teresa Bazemore, was awarded $2.4 million — much of it in bonuses — during 2022, her first full year atop the institution. SVB and First Republic now rank as the second- and third-largest bank failures in US history.

&gt;Bazemore's pay was tied to goals and other metrics the San Francisco FHLB's board set in consultation with a third-party expert and showed to regulators, said Elliot Sloane, a spokesperson for the San Francisco FHLB. “The level of advances to a member is based on a careful, thoughtful and conservative underwriting approach that takes all the relevant risk factors into account. That is our congressionally directed function,” Sloane said.

&gt;Many of the largest banks also have become accustomed to drawing financing from FHLBs, even as they pull back from lending to US homebuyers.

&gt;Wells Fargo &amp; Co., JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Citigroup Inc. — among the system’s biggest users since 2010 — collectively tapped at least $62 billion during last year’s relatively sedate markets. Citigroup’s $19 billion amounted to 3% of the total cash pool, while the firm originated only 0.3% of the nation’s mortgages in 2022, according to bank regulatory filings and federal mortgage records. Wells Fargo borrowed $32 billion before announcing in January that it’s slashing mortgage operations.

&gt;The lion’s share of US home loans are instead issued by nonbanks, such as Rocket Mortgage, which sell them to free up cash to make new loans. 

&gt;Those businesses generally aren’t eligible to tap the FHLB system.

&gt;More than 80% of the top 100 FHLB users borrowed more from the system than they loaned out as mortgages. Fourteen banks reported no originations.

&gt;One quirk of the system is that the government’s assistance doesn’t appear as a line in the US budget — sparing FHLBs the kinds of bitter congressional debates over expenditures that have gripped Washington in recent months.

&gt;Instead, government support starts with special treatment, giving FHLBs an edge in raising money cheaply. They gather most of their funding by selling bonds exempt from state and local income taxes. Buyers are also more comfortable with the debt because of the widespread assumption that if an FHLB ever runs into trouble, the government would jump in with taxpayer money to prevent default. Standard &amp; Poor’s and Moody’s have said their credit ratings for the FHLB system would be several notches lower if not for the government's presumed backing.

&gt;“The implied guarantee is also not something that's conveyed by the government,” Ryan Donovan, CEO of the Council of Federal Home Loan Banks, said in an interview. “It's something the market perceives, that we're a safe place, that our debt that we issue is solid.”

&gt;Economists vigorously debate the value of the government’s support. Defenders of the system, such as former White House adviser Jim Parrott and economist Mark Zandi, estimate it was worth around $5 billion last year, while detractors peg the boost closer to $9 billion. Some of that is passed on to banks as a discounted source of financing. It also translates into higher profits for the FHLBs, which last year produced $3.2 billion in net income.

&gt;They held on to more than half that, lifting their stockpile of retained earnings to $24.6 billion.

&gt;A portion — about $1.4 billion — was paid banks and other “members” as dividends. 

&gt;In the end, the $1.5 trillion FHLB system contributed a mere $355 million to a program supporting housing affordability last year.

&gt;“It’s embarrassing,” said Cornelius Hurley, an independent director on the board of Boston’s FHLB for about 14 years through 2021. “This is a public entity. We should be demanding more from them.”

&gt;Defenders acknowledge that the system is a quirk of history but say its ability to provide funding quickly is crucial, especially when crises erupt. FHLBs can start stabilizing lenders before they resort to tapping the Fed’s discount window, and before policymakers can meet to discuss other extraordinary measures.

&gt;Banks that do tap the discount window have to worry about stoking the very same public panic they are trying to quell.

&gt;“The members certainly could go to the Fed,” said Michael Ericson, CEO of the Chicago FHLB. “The challenge is there is a reputation risk associated with that. In talking with member institutions, they feel that the stigma is real.”

&gt;FHLBs didn’t always provide cash so freely. The system was almost comically risk-averse when President Herbert Hoover signed the law for its creation in 1932. In the first two years, hopeful borrowers filled out 41,000 applications for mortgages funded with FHLB money. Three were approved.

&gt;Back then, thrifts and insurers were the biggest lenders to homebuyers. The firms were supposed to go to local FHLBs and pledge collateral — such as home loans — to borrow cash and make additional mortgages.

&gt;But by the late 1930s, Franklin Roosevelt’s administration was creating an even simpler system: A new entity, Fannie Mae, would buy mortgages. About three decades later, Congress chartered Freddie Mac to help thrifts manage interest-rate risks. The pair gave rise to the mortgage-securities market, which funds most home loans today.

&gt;But in the 1980s, the savings and loan crisis erupted, prompting a government bailout. With so many thrifts failing, the FHLBs were losing too many members to sustain themselves. So in 1989, George H.W. Bush’s administration reached a deal to expand the FHLB system to serve thousands of banks — on the condition that 10% of profits would go toward supporting housing affordability.

&gt;FHLBs fought that requirement at the time, people involved in that process said. They now tout it as a core piece of their mission.
Sticking to the Mandate

&gt;FHLBs have to set aside 10% of their profit for affordable housing grant programs. They rarely do more.

&gt;The number of lenders using FHLBs more than doubled to more than 8,000 by 2005 — while the system’s balance sheet swelled about sixfold to $1 trillion.

&gt;But after the 2008 financial crisis, the nation’s largest banks began pulling back en masse from mortgage lending.

&gt;Wells Fargo, JPMorgan and Citigroup collectively originated 4% of residential mortgages in the country in 2022, down from 13% in 2010. Rocket Mortgage increased its market share over the same period.

&gt;Still, FHLBs continued to swell as banks sought financing, especially in emergencies. The system’s total loans to members surged 28% to $1.04 trillion in this year’s first three months, beating a record set in the third quarter of 2008.

&gt;“What the home loan banks have become is a source of general liquidity to big banks,” said Bruce Morrison, former chair of the Federal Housing Finance Board. “They’ve made a great contribution for the last 50 years, but the market has changed. They’re doing a job that the Fed should be doing.”

&gt;Most Americans aren’t familiar with the arcane system.

&gt;A software engineer from a think tank recently went on National Public Radio’s “The Indicator” to take a quiz about this year’s turmoil in US banking. Asked to identify the industry’s “lender of second-to-last resort” from a list, she paused on the correct answer: the FHLB system.

&gt;“Sounds made-up,” she said.

&gt;When deposit runs at regional banks began making headlines around the world in March, few eyes were on the FHLBs as they furiously raised money to meet the incoming demand to aid banks, issuing $304 billion of debt in one week alone.

&gt;“People underestimate how much value they bring,” said Ted Tozer, the former president of Ginnie Mae. “The record number of advances this year when there was contagion shows a lot of it happens under the covers. The FHLBs are the shock absorbers.”

&gt;FHLBs can react so quickly because it’s hard for them to lose. They have a so-called super lien on the money they lend, putting them at the front of the line to get repaid if a bank collapses. The FHLBs note that any secured lender would take priority in the event of a bank failure.

&gt;But insiders say the super lien contributes to features of FHLB loans that can make them especially egregious. It's not uncommon for banks to bend accounting rules to get bigger advances. There's also little incentive to do thorough due diligence.

&gt;“You can look at who they are lending to and see it’s not because they’re doing a good job screening for bank quality,” said Kathryn Judge, a Columbia Law School professor who focuses on financial regulation. “It’s a byproduct of the fact there’s a mechanism in place to protect their interests.”

&gt;Two people who worked in different FHLBs for more than a decade said they never saw a loan turned down, no matter how poor the financial health of an institution. What matters, they said, is getting collateral — US Treasuries, home loans, mortgage-backed securities and other real estate assets.

&gt; **Though banks often have to pledge more collateral than they borrow, they have found ways to maximize the value of that collateral. Normally, firms label assets they intend to hold short term as “available for sale.” If the value of those assets fall in the market, the bank marks them down on its books and takes an immediate hit to its earnings. **

&gt; **But firms may avoid markdowns by moving assets to a longer-term accounting bucket dubbed “held-to-maturity.” That allows them to preserve the value of collateral they present when borrowing from an FHLB.**

&gt; **Charles Schwab Corp.’s banking arm shifted $189 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities to that category last year. The firm borrowed $12.4 billion from the FHLB system through the end of 2022, and had the capacity to borrow $68.6 billion, according to an annual report. In the first quarter of 2023, its FHLB loans more than tripled.**

&gt;The FHLBs don’t track how banks use their financing. The lifelines can help troubled banks avoid fire sales of assets. But if a firm’s balance sheet is in bad shape, collateralized lending may do little more than postpone the bank’s inevitable demise, potentially letting losses worsen. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is left to clean up the mess.

&gt;“That delay makes a difference,” said Judge, the law professor. “Fresh liquidity allows them to limp on longer rather than evaluate their own viability.”

&gt;After the Fed embarked on a rapid series of rate hikes early last year, Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic watched their assets lose value and their financial condition worsen until depositors panicked and FHLB lifelines were no longer enough. The FDIC estimates their failures will cost its main insurance fund more than $31 billion, including coverage of uninsured deposits that will be paid by a special assessment on the industry.

&gt;Meanwhile, the FHLBs and their lobbying arm boast that they’ve never had a loss on a loan in more than eight decades.

&gt;Large banks borrow from many sources, sometimes including more than one FHLB, putting the regional hubs under pressure to compete for business. A former official described how one of the nation’s four giant commercial banks played regional FHLBs off of each other, scoring better rates and terms.

&gt;Earlier this year, the FHLB of Chicago announced a sweetener for its members: “Early bird discounts.”

&gt;Through May 31, the FHLB promised better rates for loans given before 10 a.m. Banks could also get “volume discounts” if they took out advances larger than $100 million, according to its website.

&gt;Such gamesmanship irks policy advocates such as Aaron Klein, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “No banks should be able to arbitrage the FHLBs against each other,” he said. “Members should only be allowed one.”

&gt;Chicago FHLB’s Ericson said that enticing members to come in the morning helps with planning and that it’s increasingly common for banks to borrow from just one FHLB.

&gt;Last year, the FHLB’s overseer — the Federal Housing Finance Agency — announced it would conduct a sweeping review of the system to consider whether it needs to be dramatically reshaped. The agency’s director, Sandra Thompson, later signaled dissatisfaction: “The status quo is not acceptable,” she said at a Brookings symposium in February.

&gt;But in the wake of March’s regional banking blowup, Biden administration regulators have been emphasizing the importance of FHLBs in stabilizing the industry’s balance sheets. “Through this period of market stress, the FHLBanks remained in a safe and sound condition and continued to serve their critical role,” Thompson told a congressional panel in May.

&gt;Her agency’s recommendations are expected later this year.

&gt;Some FHLBs are starting to voluntarily pay 50% more than required to housing affordability, and others are in the process of doing so, Donovan wrote to Thompson in March. That would raise their contribution to 15% of their profits.

&gt;Meanwhile, there’s a measure for consideration in Congress that would boost it to 20%. Housing advocates say that’s not enough, arguing that improving affordability should be a more central part of the business model than carving off a slice.

&gt;That wouldn’t include offering better financing terms to Community Development Financial Institutions, which fill gaps in lending to communities, such as minorities or people with low incomes or living in rural areas. The organizations often have to put up more collateral than banks and have a harder time accessing funding even though they more directly address affordability.

&gt;The FHLBs now have around 6,800 members. About 1% are CDFIs. At the same time, more than 500 insurers, including giants like MetLife Inc. that no longer play a pivotal role in housing, are some of the system’s biggest borrowers. On its website, investment firm Wellington Management urges insurers to burnish their profits by drawing even more FHLB money for leverage.

&gt;“You can be outraged but the outrage is in their purpose,” said Morrison, the former Federal Housing Finance Board chair. “The question is whether we really need this huge trillion-dollar institution or if they should be restyled. They serve a private purpose with public subsidy.”"|0.96|1204.0|0.0|1204.0

I'd appreciate someone's input on the discrepancy in valuations reported by Morningstar with that of an ETF's fund documents. Consider [AVDV, an actively managed Avantis fund](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/avantis-investments/avantis-international-small-cap-value-etf/) that tracks small cap value companies outside of the US and in developed markets. It is extremely diversified within its segment, [with 1336 companies](https://i.imgur.com/bE0NH1A.png) and [none with more than 0.75% weight](https://i.imgur.com/Au4jmmc.png). The weighted average market cap is $1.7B--where by weighted they multiply each market cap by its weight in the ETF, not simply averaging the market caps. This is stated in [their definition](https://i.imgur.com/g4UPsTi.png). They go on to calculate similar weighted valuation metrics:

- Weighted Average Book/Market 1.06x [i.e., B/P]
- Weighted Average Profits/Book of 0.32x. [i.e. E/B]
- An implied E/P ratio of (1.06)*(0.32) = 0.34
- An implied **P/E ratio** of 1 / (0.34) = **2.94**
- An implied **P/B ratio** of 1 / 1.06 = **0.94**.

On the other hand, [Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/avdv/portfolio) states that the **P/E of AVDV was 7.16** and the **P/B is 0.84**. [Here are all their valuation metrics.](https://i.imgur.com/zpIuixB.png)

Why is Morningstar giving a P/E ratio that is 2.94x higher than the fund documents? Is this because Morningstar doesn't do any weighting and literally just averages the P/E of every company in the ETF no matter its weight? Does it have to do with the treatment of negative earnings companies? Simultaneously, Morningstar has a P/B ratio of 0.84 which is *lower* than the Avantis document's implied 0.94 ratio. So Morningstar has a more expensive P/E ratio but cheaper P/B ratio.

Both sources indicate this sector and ETF is extremely cheap, but I'm very interested in if it is as cheap as implied by Avantis."|0.5|0.0|0.0|0.0

t3_140fbqd|1685890189.0|investing|HELP. Im terrible with money.|Back story on me, Im a single 34y/o self taught artist. I made some pretty bad financial decisons in my 20 s that ive slowly been working my way out of. I dont have to much debt under 5k but i have on repo on my record (gross I know). I planned on paying it all off by the end of summer. I live nomadically and well below my means. Anyways, my father is in control of an UGMA UTMA account  of mine (with about 16k in it)  and has been forever. Unless he releases the money or i take him to court (which I will not, because money at the end of that isnt worth that much hassle to me) I dont have access to it. At first this was frustrating to me, but now not so much. My Father has seen me make better financial decisions and in turn has given me loans against my nest egg. i dont mind doing this but im at a point where i would rather just ask him to invest somewhere where i can do somthing similar. A type of savings account that accures interests that i can also take loans against. He always talk about IRAs or 401ks, others have told me about whole term life insurance policies but all of this is another langauge to me.  Im totally clueless. Im a fucking artist. Im just grateful people even buy my work, but im past that now and need to figure out how to keep my buisness growing and invest this nest egg.|0.2|0.0|0.0|0.0

# Federal Reserve

* **Goolsbee (Neutral). Weekend:** Trying to make it a point not to prejudge and make decision when we're still weeks out from the next FOMC meeting, we are going to get a lot of important data between now and then.
* **Barkin (Neutral). Tue:** There is uncertainty around where rates need to go, it would be shocking if rates fell again to zero in a future recession, hopes that rates can stat at a ""neutral, normal"" level for some time, seeing evidence that rate hikes are curbing demand, CRE strain appears focused in B and C quality office buildings in downtown areas and not the entire sector.
* **Mester (Hawk). Wed:** No compelling reason to wait on rate hikes, more of a compelling case for bringing rates up and then holding for a while, decision could still be swayed by NFP and the next inflation report.
* **Bowman (Neutral). Wed:** Residential real estate appears to be rebounding with implications for the Fed's inflation battle, while lower rents will eventually be reflected in inflation data home prices themselves are levelling out.
* **Collins (Neutral). Wed:** Inflation is simply too high, the Fed is intent on reducing inflation.
* **Jefferson (Neutral). Wed:** Skipping a rate increase at the coming meeting would allow us to see more data before deciding on the extent of additional tightening, holding rates constant should not be taken to mean rates have reached a peak for this tightening cycle, inflation remains too high but some measures have been slowing, monetary policy works with a lag and a year is not long enough to feel the full effect, base case outlook is not for a recession.
* **Harker (Neutral). Wed:** I am in the camp that we can skip a meeting, it would be a skip and not a pause, a pause says you may hold there for a while and I don't know that we're ready for that yet, data still to come may change my mind, need some slowing in the labour market, the economy keeps chugging along, not seeing much of a credit crunch after SVB. Thu: My preference is for skipping a rate hike, it's prudent to skip a rate hike in June, let's skip and see how it goes, we are close to the place where we can hold rates in place, sees promising signs that the Fed's rate hikes are working, disinflation is disappointingly slow, if inflation started coming down unexpectedly fast then we could cut rates but that is not my forecast, sees 2023 GDP growth below 1% and unemployment at 4.4%, expects inflation to fall to around 3.5% this year and 2.5% next year with 2% in 2025.
* **Bullard (Hawk). Thu:** Rates are at the low end of what is arguably sufficiently restrictive, monetary policy landscape in much better shape today with the FFR at a more appropriate level than it was a year ago.

# European Central Bank

* **Wunsch (Neutral). Weekend:** We hiked 400 bps and we might have to do more, we have more ground to cover, real rates are still quite low, if fiscal policy remains supportive then monetary policy will have to do more to get inflation under control.
* **De Cos (Dove). Mon:** Policy tightening is well underway but based on the information currently available to us we have some way to go, interest rates will have to remain in restrictive territory for an extended period of time.
* **Simkus (Hawk). Tue:** Expects a 25 bps rate hike in June and July, September is too early to say.
* **Centeno. Wed:** Spain's CPI reading shows that Europe's inflation is easing, doesn't see a risk of monetary policy overshooting, reversal of supply shock should slow inflation.
* **Villeroy (Neutral). Wed:** It is quite likely that inflation has passed its peak in France, perseverance counts for more than speed regarding monetary policy, will bring inflation down to 2% between now and 2025, markets are absorbing QT smoothly and positively. **Thu:** Upcoming rate hikes will be marginal, rate hikes are beginning to have an impact on inflation, we will bring inflation back to 2% by 2025.
* **De Guindos (Dove). Wed:** Inflation data today and yesterday has been positive, victory over inflation is not there yet but the trajectory is correct. **Thu:** A big part of our journey to raise rates has been done but there is still some way to go, recent inflation data are positive but still far from target.
* **Müller (Hawk). Wed:** Very likely that we will hike by 25 bps more than once, probably too optimistic to see rate cuts in early 2024, core inflation shows no signs of slowing yet.
* **Visco (Dove). Wed:** Must proceed with the correct degree of graduality now that rates are in restrictive territory, longer-term inflation expectations remain in line with the definition of price stability.
* **Kazaks (Hawk). Thu:** It is hard to say where interest rates will peak but rates will stay at their peak for a while.
* **Rehn (Neutral). Thu:** The monetary policy journey is not over yet, core inflation must slow before mulling easing, the inflation outlook continues to be too high for too long, a lasting rise in inflation expectations is an upside risk to inflation, the lags and the strength of policy transmission to the real economy remain uncertain.
* **Lagarde (Dove). Thu:** We need to continue with rate hikes until we are sufficiently confident that inflation is on track to return to 2% in a timely manner, we cannot say that we are satisfied with the inflation outlook, a period of catch-up wage growth need not cause unduly persistent inflation over time, rate hikes are already feeding forcefully into bank lending conditions.
* **Panetta (Neutral). Fri:** We have not reached the end of the rate hike cycle but we aren't far away from it, inflation is too high but there is no reason to worry, now is not the time to be too hasty raising rates, the debate will soon shift from level of interest rates to that of maintaining them over time, cannot rule out a technical recession in the Eurozone, committed to getting inflation back to 2% target.
* **Vasle. Fri:** More rate hikes needed to get inflation to 2% target, core inflation remains high and persistent.
* **Makhlouf. Fri:** Likely to see another rate hike at the next meeting, beyond probable hikes in June and July the picture is a lot less clear, inflation fall is very welcome but not definitive and underlying pressures are still quite strong.

# Bank of England

* **Mann (Hawk). Wed:** The gap between UK headline and core inflation is more persistent than in the US and the Eurozone, in core we do start to see implications coming through pricing channels and wage negotiations into something that is persistent.

# Reserve Bank of Australia

* **Lowe. Wed:** Monetary policy is in restrictive territory, the RBA is in data-dependent mode, wage growth has not been a source of inflation, there is not a single variable that drives RBA policy decisions, one factor behind May rate increase was to reinforce the RBA is serious about getting inflation down, inflation expectations are well anchored and we can't take this for granted, the RBA is serious about the inflation target but also want to preserve labour market gains, mid-2025 is pressing the length of time we can reasonably take to achieve the inflation target, the risk to inflation is to the upside and we need to be attentive to that.

# Swiss National Bank

* **Jordan. Wed:** We need to bring inflation below 2% as soon as possible, the longer inflation stays above 2% the harder it is to bring it down, sees inflation risks higher than deflation in the future due to deglobalisation, rising rates are positive for the banking system and will not damage financial stability in Switzerland, concerned about the speed and size of outflow of deposits.
* **Schlegel. Fri:** Cannot rule out further monetary policy tightening, ready to be active in forex markets to ensure appropriate monetary conditions, cannot sound the all-clear on inflation despite recent dips in the data, inflationary pressure is broadening.

# Bank of Japan

* **Ueda. Tue:** We have not reached sustainable 2% inflation, will patiently maintain easy policy as there is still distance to go to stable 2% inflation, will continue bond buying operations, inflation will slow a great deal around the middle of FY 2023 and is likely to rebound after that but uncertainty is high. **Wed:** Whether inflation is caused by demand or supply has important implications for monetary policy decision making, increase in inflationary pressure has been cause by supply factors, recent global inflation has also been influenced by demand factors, it may be difficult to deny the possibility that we are already in a new normal that is different from the period of ""low for long"" inflation. **Fri:** Will maintain massive monetary easing as it will take more time to achieve our price target, buying of J-REITs is part of massive monetary easing, not the time to debate specific exit strategy including possible sale of J-REIT holdings, CPI likely to slow quite clearly in mid-to-later half of the current fiscal year, trend inflation likely to heighten ahead but will take time.
* **Kanda. Tue:** Closely watching FX moves, will respond appropriately if necessary, not focussing on specific levels, important for currencies to move stably and reflect economic fundamentals, no intention for today's meeting to serve as a verbal intervention against Yen weakening.
* **Suzuki (FinMin). Fri:** Exchange rates are driven by various factors, a weak Yen has various impact on Japan's economy such as exports and import prices.

t3_13zydll|1685846470.0|investing|Investing with Wells Fargo &amp; WMPXX (5.19%)|"Never in my life have I thought I’d open an account with Wells Fargo, but I did to take advantage of their $2500 Premier checking offer. I had to open the account in branch, and it was surprisingly smooth and pleasant. It also seems like the Premier checking account is almost fee-free (wire transfer, ATM withdrawal, etc.) other than the monthly maintenance fee, which is avoidable. I’m linking my new WellsTrade account to it to invest the money instead of parking it in the checking account.

Two questions:

1) Is it safe to invest with Wells Fargo/WellsTrade? 

The internet isn’t very fond of WF in general, but I’m mainly interested in the financial health of the company. I know it’s one of the largest banks in the country, but people were even worried about Fidelity/Vanguard/Charles Schwab, so…

2) Is WMPXX safe to invest in? 

It’s a prime MMF owned/managed by Allspring/WF. I appreciate that its yield, 5.19%, is even higher than Vanguard’s or Fidelity’s MMFs, but am I risking my money with it? I see that it’s an institutional fund and the assets it holds are huge. Just concerned due to the lack of info—just like WellsTrade.

Any insights are appreciated!

t3_13zuro2|1685837679.0|investing|At what point will index fund investing stop working?|"The money in an index fund is used to purchase shares of all the equities in the index. The underlying intrinsic value and performance of those equities will never be considered by the shareholders.

As many are quick to point out, most big cap stocks are currently heavily overpriced. For example, [Pepsi](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PEP?p=PEP) currently costs $38.67 per $1 of profit today. Who would pay that price for a company that only [grows](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PEP/analysis?p=PEP) ~8% per year at best? Its top three [shareholders](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PEP/holders?p=PEP) are Vanguard, State Street and Black Rock.

How much of the blame for overpricing goes to passive investors who shovel money into everything regardless of its value or performance? I'm perfectly guilty of this myself of course.

Passive investors dream of cashing out on that compounded 9.1%/year growth of the S&amp;P 500 over time, and we can all backtest and see that past performance. But we can't really backtest the ever-increasing observer effect that index investing must have over time.

To get to the point, at what point does the S&amp;P 500 simply track the performance of index funds and render the stock market a meaningless Ponzi scheme? Or have I simply gone bonkers to think about this, and if so, what am I missing?

Charlie Munger has often [pointed out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tojx4J2HYD4) that index investing doesn't work if everyone does it.

I maintain an interest in investing, however I only poke and prod around at a novice level at best. In addition to my pension, I've been contributing to an IRA and brokerage account since I started working full time at the age of 26. I started out with a measly $50 dollars a month and am now up to about $600/month.

I have invested nearly EVERYTHING into ETFs. I fully understand a little bit of knowledge is dangerous and that all my eggs are in one basket. Combine this with the fact that I've started to amass a nice little sum, and I'm really leaning toward having some type of proper fund management company to handle my investments from here on out. I should not here that the ETFs have performed incredibly in the 12 years I've been in them.

So, I signed up for a 457(B) plan at work and figured I'd just do my own little test and see which one is performing better. After about a year of monitoring I'm seeing my ETF rate of returns (.04% expense ratio) are completely crushing the rate of return on my properly managed account (expense ratio 1-2%.... can't remember).

**My question**: Does it make sense to leave what has worked for me for the past 12 years to go to a properly managed account even if the rate of return is lower, just because it seems safer and seems like what I'm supposed to do?

I signed up for their newsletter (around $30/mo) and invested about $1M in all the stocks in their main portfolio at the same ratios they do.

The past year and a half since I did this have been rough, and I know everyone can have a bad day, so I've been waiting it out.  But I became impatient and noticed that they don't generally publish their annual returns.  After digging a bit I learned that their founder, a guy by the name of Al Frank was considered to be a good investor and he racked up better than average returns until his death in 2002.  Since then, their returns have been at or below the S&amp;P 500.

So basically, people are impressed with their high return rate, and you think they must know what they are doing since they've been doing it for over 40 years, but turns out they are averaging in their less than stellar returns over the past 20 years into the overall number, and they still look like geniuses.

Time marches on, yet some things remain the same. So far, no headwind has been strong enough to halt the bullish momentum - not inflation, not the debt ceiling drama, and not the Silvergate and SVB crashes. 

Even the tightening of the corporate real estate market doesn't seem to be enough to unnerve investors. So, should analysts concede they were mistaken, and that neither the economy nor the market faces imminent danger? Perhaps they underestimated the resilience of the ""buy the dip"" mentality?

Of course, no one will admit such a thing outright. Instead, they attempt to validate their stance by presenting new grounds for a trend reversal. The newest harbinger of economic doom is now identified as the U.S. Treasury. The argument is that issuing more bonds, coupled with Quantitative Tightening (QT), should drive up T-bill yields and strain the financial system. At first glance, this claim seems plausible. Issuing around $1 trillion worth of notes could indeed further sap liquidity. The crux of the matter is whether the market can absorb all this new supply, and on this point, opinions diverge. 

Some maintain that there won't be sufficient bank reserves to accommodate it all, suggesting that the price of T-bills should fall sufficiently to offer a return above the Reverse Repo rate (RRP). Others contend that, while there will likely be a reshuffling of investor funds from one cash-like instrument to another, there will not be a removal from the market for any significant duration. 

One thing I can agree with unequivocally is that this will invert the yield curve regardless. Does that mean the celebration is likely to continue? Until there's a **robust S&amp;P 500 breach of the 4300 level**, it's premature to anticipate a new bull market phase.

By rolling my MPW position forward and taking a bit more time risk at the same strike I'm at now, I'll have generated the liquidity to get 600 shares of SLG that will be hedged such that I won't feel pain until it drops under about 12.21 per share, if it comes to that.

FRNs are a relatively new US Treasury instrument, starting in the year 2013. FRNs are indexed against the 13W Treasury but plus a ""spread"" that's determined at auction. For example, today's FRNs are +0.169%. So an FRN today would be around 0.169% higher than the 13W Treasury (which is itself, determined on a weekly basis and will float).

In effect, FRNs are for people who plan to build a 13W bond ladder (plus get a wee bit more interest on top of that), but are otherwise far more convenient than clicking the buy  button all the time. FRNs just make money over the next 2 years when they mature, or can be sold earlier than that.

Anyone have experience with FRNs that they'd like to share? They seem like a good almost-cash like (or perhaps... more BIL-like) instrument. They seem to be liquid, float with the short-term rate (which is substantially good right now), and very low risk.

t3_13xrkif|1685649361.0|investing|How to improve upon flawed stock picking contests?|"I am starting a stocking picking contest for high school kids with the goals of getting them interested in investing and educating them (at least somewhat) about investing. A traditional stock picking contest involves participants picking one or more stocks and then basing the winner on how those stocks perform during the timeframe specified by the contest (typically 1-3 months, though this could vary). The problem with those stock picking contests is that they teach the absolute wrong lessons about investing, since the winner is typically someone who bets on high risk companies and gets lucky. (Assuming you have 100+ participants, this will always be the case.) 

How could I structure such a contest to teach better lessons about investing? One obvious solution would be to extend the timeframe, but realistically I can only expect to engage them for so long. Anything extending beyond the school year is not practical, and probably nothing more than a few months. Another idea is to require a write-up on the stock and/or investment strategy and basing part of the scores on that. Could also somehow factor in volatility (historical or during the contest time window) and adjust the returns based on that.

Does anyone else have ideas on how to improve upon the contest for educational purposes? I am open to pretty much anything, though I think it probably needs to include some element of tracking their score based on the stock market performance each day.

Edit: Thanks for all of the suggestions so far. Definitely some good food for thought. Importantly, I probably should have clarified that I am not a teacher. This contest is going to be sponsored by an educational non-profit and it will span across multiple school districts in partnership with the schools. I will not be teaching the kids directly, but I can provide lessons and guidance to the teachers who oversee the contest participants at their respective schools.

With that context in mind, I think this probably needs to be some sort of contest with a prize in order to engage schools and students. I don’t think we could just provide lesson materials and expect it to gain any traction."|0.77|21.0|0.0|21.0

Do you buy back the contracts? 
Hold on and hope the share price drops before the expiration? 

**** Is there any financial difference between me paying to buy the calls back now at a premium or letting my share get sold? ****

Let’s assume the stock price is $20 or so more than the strike, does it behove me to buy back the calls or let my shares get sold? Or is the math basically the same? I’d the share price continues to go up, say $5-10 from here, for every $1 up, does the call cost the same to buy back? Is there a formula or website that can help me compute this with hypotheticals? 

Didn’t expect these names to pop up so fast so soon. Still making money on the shares, but the options I guess cancels that out."|0.8|3.0|0.0|3.0

For those who don't have access to full articles on Bloomberg, here are the key points:

It’s not yet apparent that core inflation has peaked in the euro zone, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said, **pledging further increases in borrowing costs** ***(meaning more hikes)*****.**

**“There is no clear evidence that underlying inflation has peaked,” Lagarde said Thursday in a speech in Hanover, Germany. “We have made clear that we still have ground to cover to bring interest rates to sufficiently restrictive levels.”**

While headline came down last month, core price pressures, however, moderated by less, meaning more tightening is needed to ensure the 2% inflation target is reached.

Speaking Wednesday, ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos warmed that he “could not say that the victory is there so far.” Fellow rate-setter Madis Muller said **more than one additional quarter-point rate move is likely.**

**Hope this helps. Stay informed.**"|0.63|2.0|0.0|2.0

All I have there is index funds and ETFs. All of them have no leverage (=X1). 

Over the months, I noticed my ""cash available"" has been decreasing, and there was no indication as to why and how. I got in touch. It turned out this is due to overnight/rollover fees. 

Fine, but these only apply to CFDs. If I invest in no-leverage stuff, I was assuming it's not CFDs... I mean, basic stuff like NASDAQ-100 index fund. I'm not sure why I am being charged overnight fees.

Question: Should I put up with this nonsense? Or is this common practice everywhere? What's your experience with that?

The fees are not a huge amount, but it feels like everything you get on that platform now automatically counts as CFD. And I find that misleading.

I am selling a Short Term Rental (STR) property that i own as i am not bullish on this sector. Right now it cash flows about 25k per year, all of which goes to my wife for spending money. This return is taxed as income as a single member LLC.

I want to replace the cash flow/spending money and am thinking of investing the cash into some other type of vehicle, perhaps a dividend growth fund and having the distributions deposited into her account to replace the spending money, rather than re-invested into the portfolio.

I'm still actively trying to grown my net worth via asset growth strategies and am 15-20 years or so away from retirement.

I think that I read that dividend investing is not a great strategy, and usually it is better to re-invest dividends and sell principle each month, although i am struggling to see why that would be since the dividends will be taxed at a lower rate than short term capital gains, plus there's a set a forget approach to putting the cash into dividend stock/ETF and having the money hit her account.

Would this be a suitable approach to replace the rental income from the STR?

As a result, instead of economic unrest, we saw consistent market indices.

Deutsche Bank [reports](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-are-markets-so-calm-its-revenge-of-the-quant-funds-26a93425?mod=rss_markets_main) that quant funds' net share of US assets reached their highest levels since December 2021. Coupled with active corporate stock buybacks, the S&amp;P 500 has swayed less than 1% in either direction for 36 out of the last 46 sessions.

So, what's the mechanism here?

As volatility subsides, quants press 'Buy.' This happened when regulators intervened to prevent a banking crisis, and the Fed indicated an end to rate hikes.

Here you might be asking yourself, “but when the **VIX** surges, shouldn’t funds counterintuitively reduce their positions?”

Theoretically, yes. Practically, however, no.

Take the May 2019 market crash, when the S&amp;P 500 dropped by around 7% amid panic over the US-China trade war. McElligott estimates quants jettisoned $35 billion worth of stocks within a month.

Of course, you probably noticed that the VIX crossed 20 twice in May. So…why no crash?

First, we don't fully understand quant fund algorithms.

Second, retail investor backing has grown.

Additionally, last week's favorable Nvidia report played its role. The total market cap of AI-related firms swelled by nearly $100 billion in a day.

If all of this is true, then when will the long-awaited correction occur?

Corrections often come when market confidence is high and a 'bullish trend' appears all but irreversible. Once investors start buying every dip, convinced that a surge is imminent...that's usually when the rug gets pulled out from under them—not when everyone is on high alert, shorting left and right, but when they aren’t."|0.56|3.0|0.0|3.0

It also released a new chip that brings AI to smartphones. While the applications are limited to battery monitoring and camera improvements (hardware based) right now, they can easily move to other areas of enhancements. 

Regarding loss of revenues from Apple, it will still take Apple 3-4 years to phase out existing devices that use Qualcomm chips. The 5 billion revenue Qualcomm gets from Apple will be covered by IoT + automotive by then.

Lastly, people can only delay buying a smartphone, not avoid it completely, especially buying high end phones. Which means once the slump is over, Qualcomm will make a very strong comeback.

Any thoughts? I want to buy more but would love to hear some critical arguments in the mean time.

Edit: Qualcomm's also making PC chips. Remains to be seen if they can eat Intel's lunch like AMD.

I'm not super interested in talking about the virtues of doing or not doing (or doing then undoing) what they did. What I am interested in is, do you think the stock is super overreacting, like a reverse meme stock? 

BUD definitely has had some sales declines, but I don't know about Target and Kohls. Is it possible that earnings are going to come and everything will look fine or even good, then the stock pops because everybody realizes it was a social media overreaction? Or do you think they're taking real, heavy losses?

I have a quick question about taxes when selling stock at a profit.

Yes, I am aware of long term and short term tax rates - long term is 1 year hold at a minimum, and short term is less than a year taxed at whatever bracket you find yourself in.

But what if there is a mix of long and short term?

Suppose I buy 100 shares of stock A at 10 dollars a share. The value since then tanks 80%, to 2 dollars per share.

I decide to hang on to this. A year passes by and I see this stock at 2 dollars and decide to buy 100 more shares.

I am now invested 1200 dollars into this, with 6 dollar average cost.

Six months after I buy additional 100 shares, the stock miraculously goes up to 12 bucks per share and I decide to sell.

How am I being taxed now:

1. 100 shares are considered long term and 100 shares are considered short term
2. All of it is now being considered short term.

I can either short sell the underlying or short sell a call option. Which is better?

My retail broker TDA allows me to sell naked call options, earning interest on the premium, without any interest expenses. A Jan 2024 180 call option can be sold for 243.44 using the midpoint. As an aside, since SPY is selling at 420.49 (nice), that excess 0.95 (243.44-420.49) can be interpreted as the cost of leverage. 

Short selling SPY would yield me a larger premium (420.49 rather than 243.44), but my broker charges me 10% to borrow the stock. 

If my math is right, short selling the underlying would cost ~8% more than selling the option. While is it’s true that the upside is capped so short selling the call would underperform when the underlying moves below the strike, let’s assume the chance of that happening is negligible.

The market seems to be pricing a pretty significant decline in interest rates based on the forward SOFR curve. Does anyone think this not right?

Just log on to your Amazon account and have a look at items you bought in 2020 or early 2021. Every single item that I have bought has increased 25% to 100%+ in the past 3 years. You see it at Costco, you see it at restaurants.

Wage growth has only really occurred on a percentage basis for the lower skilled minimum wage job, and nowhere enough to cover the massive cost of living increases.

Is wage price inflation off the table because people are too scared of losing their jobs? Do people just accept a lower standard of living than before?

I can really only see inflation going away if people accept a lower standard of living and not push for higher wages.

EDIT: Not saying inflation is going to 0%, but I'm thinking it's too early to assume we are headed back down to 2% and the job is done. I think it's way more likely we stay in this 4% to 5% range or even head higher from here if wage inflation starts to kick in because people are not content with the diminished buying power."|0.22|0.0|0.0|0.0

Additionally, the time frame between the graph reaching zero and then declining back to zero represents the duration it took to recover from each fall. This is why you can observe a significant ""window"" from 1929 until around 1955 (approximately), as it took more than 20 years to recover from that particular crash.

Now up ~175% YTD, in a market that has rallied strongly since the start of the year, with AI being the hot new thing, there is talks of Nvidia (and AI in general) being a bubble. That Nvidia is overvalued.

But I want to point this out: despite the 25% jump in price this week, NVDA shares actually got **cheaper** on a forward P/E basis.

https://i.imgur.com/xPQR2OF.png

Prior to the report, it was traded at ~60x forward earnings. After the report, it trades at ~50x. And that 50x is only ~1 standard deviation away from it's 5 year average range.

This relative valuation holds for pretty much every metric

https://i.imgur.com/iMejuuf.png

Relative to it's peers, Nvidia, despite the massive single day jump, doesn't trade much more than above it's historical average.

https://i.imgur.com/4nP2u9w.png

Why is this? Because in hindsight, analyst expectations were somehow *too low*.

One year forward revenue grew from ~$30B to ~$40B, a 33% jump

Two year forward revenue went from ~$37B to ~$50B, a 35% jump

One year forward EPS went from ~$4.55 to ~$7, a 55% jump

Two year forward EPS went from ~$6.50 to ~$9.60, a 46% jump

2025 operating profit expectations a week ago were $16.6B. After reporting, now $27B

Forward gross margins went from 67.5% to 70.5%

Forward free cash flow went from $11.4B to $20.4B

I know it sounds like beating a dead horse here, but Nvidia just gave guidance that is them screaming that a transformational change is incoming.

Will the stock continue to keep going up every day? Of course not. But the calls of Nvidia being overvalued based simply on price action is ignoring the fundamental shift."|0.86|167.0|0.0|167.0

Further, it looks like they're just looting the company, though they acknowledge that dilution is their business model so maybe that's not as horrible as it sounds. I feel like the average investor here just keeps getting killed. To be honest, I don't know why the execs would exercise their options except to immediately sell shares.

Is this company as bad as it looks? Is it typical of a small prospecting company?

t3_13tid0q|1685221940.0|investing|Moving to a new home - Does keeping the current home as a rental property/RE investment worth it?|"Hey all,

So we're going to move to a new home in the next year and will have to decide whether to keep our current home or sell it upon moving.

We have a relatively large equity in this home - Home value is about $700k per RedFin and $200k mortgage left. I did a high-level calc. Rental estimate is $3,951. Taking out mortgage, property tax, insurance and HOA, we would get roughly $1,500 net cashflow per month, without counting tax or any repair cost. So that's **about 3.6% ROE on $500K equity (rental income only)**? I haven't been a landlord before so not sure if I missed anything. But I assume the actual ROE will be even lower with all the repair and maintenance etc. On the flip, we're in a good home market. Many people moving in from other states and home price/rents are raising in the last few years. It does not look like this trend will end very soon.

This makes me wonder if it's a good idea to sell the home and invest like I normally would or hold it. For a simple example, S&amp;P500 has always out-performed real estate index no matter what periods I tried to back-test it. Even if I do miss the ""income"" piece at some point, there're things like SCHD with 3-4% dividend yield and higher total return even without DRIP. Plus it's hassle-free to hold an ETF than a rental home.

What would you do in this case and any thought/comment is highly appreciated!

(Also a side note - There's some of psychological effect comes into plays here. We come from a certain demographic group where people, especially older generation, value RE as the pinnacle of investing (yes Asian). Not saying people would brag about how many homes they own. But most have a strong preference of tangible assets over financial assets and RE is consider the ""textbook"" approach to grow/preserve wealth in a long run. Obviously, I'm not fully convinced by this idea but it still haunts me quite a bit over the years.)"|0.62|6.0|0.0|6.0

I noticed an increasing number of alt investment platforms are offering individual fine art pieces (mostly paintings) or funds with multiple pieces. They often have expected rates of return over 20% for a multi-year term. (Looking at you, Masterworks and Yeildstreet.)

It seems like the fine art investment trend is tied to the NFT trend which, my assessment, is all about perceived value and speculation. In other words, this is the type of investment where you could go to zero or get stuck holding the bag. However, there seems to be a lot of people dumping money into NFTs and art investments. Do they have money to burn or is this a good diversification tool?

Owning a portion of a Banksey or Warhol sounds like a viable strategy, but I've not heard anyone come out the other side of a fine art investment. Frankly, I've not heard a lot of NFT success stories.

So what would be the outcome: 

1. Will the companies make massive lay-offs and therefore increase the unemployment a lot, so there would be very low consumer spending because a lot of people would be jobless, so the companies will lower their sales/revenues.
2. The companies will not make lay-offs and would keep and pay the same salary to the employees who would work much less, like in 8 hour working time they would work for like 3-4 hours and get the same salary as before when they worked 8 hours because AI would be doing their job for them.

Moody, unreliable, unpredictable. Yeah it posts some good gains but you wouldn't invest in it over the gold standard SP500 because it might crash or be too volatile.

Well I thought that way before but am starting to take a different mindset. Tech really isn't going anywhere. The internet was objectively humankind's biggest advancement in the past couple hundred years. AI is still young, and what other technologies or advancements are yet to be made that we can't even dream of?

What is the leader of modern day advancements and technologies? Tech. It's not Home Depot or Walmart or Walt Disney Co, and by the way most of the top SP500 constituents are actually tech.

&amp;#x200B;

If you bought the NASDAQ at the very height of the internet bubble you would still be outperforming the S&amp;P today. If you bought into NASDAQ in 2008 lows you would be up over double what the S&amp;P has returned. If you bought NASDAQ the day it was tradable you would be up over double the S&amp;P has returned - almost 25 years of data. If you bought the NASDAQ at the December 2021 highs before the recent crash you are today at parody with S&amp;P returns.

For example, if I sell stock A for a $1000 loss, sell stock B for a $1000 gain, and then immediately buy back stock B on the same day, how much tax do I owe at the end of the year?

  
Would I be net neutral not have to pay capital gains on the appreciation of stock B? In other words, can I ""cash out"" my gains on a stock to offset my other losses but say invested on that same ticker? Thanks!"|0.5|0.0|0.0|0.0

I was pitched a spread of a few structured notes, one with auto calls yearly starting at 13.5% with principal protection of 30%.   It's structured out 7 years with the final year reaching 94% return - which is I think 9% equivalent over the term. 

There's another note at 7 years with a 120% return.  

These are both based on a Canadian index and are called if the index is flat or higher at term. 

Apologies, I likely screwed up some lingo but I think I have put it down so you can pick it up.  Happy to clarify anything. 

I'm told these are back tested 30 years and over the full term the odds of them being called approach 100%.  

Grains of salt with all of this, but it makes sense to my lament ears.  

I'm thinking of putting some money in this but will keep some for ETF's or other ideas.

Free cash flow is typically found by just taking the operating cash flow and subtracting the general expenses (CAPEX) following all operation activity. However, stock based compensation gets included into operating cash flow activities and therefore adds to the free cash flow total.

This led me to wonder if I should subtract the stock based compensation from the total cash flow as stock based compensation is actually just a non-cash expense of the business and does dilute existing shareholders. This is shockingly significant however as many newer and mostly tech companies generate ridiculous amounts of there cash flow from stock based compensation which is extremely deceptive (ex. ADSK, TEAM, PLTR, NVDA).

This led me to ask if it makes sense to subtract stock based compensation from cash flow , include it in cash flow, or something else.

It makes me think that if a large investor or hedge fund was able to build relationships with lower-level employees at corporations, they could get a feel for what is going on inside the company, and make decisions accordingly.

I see positives and negatives to both.|"I have both a normal brokerage account and a Roth IRA that I contribute to currently.  For the most part, when it comes to individual stocks, I put the blue-chip, high dividend paying stocks in my Roth IRA - the thought being that I can just re-invest the dividends and don't have to pay any taxes on them.  I get compound growth and presumably when I reach 65, I should have a good return...as pretty much all of these dividend paying stocks are large, blue-chip type stocks that should be fairly stable over the years.

For my more risky, shooting for the stars type investments, I've been putting those stock purchases in my normal brokerage account.  None of them pay any dividends, so I don't have to worry about taxes, and it will probably be many years before they ever do.  But the more I start thinking about it, the more I am not sure.  If one of these early stages growth stocks goes up 10x, I am going to want to sell it, and I'll be stuck paying a 20% cap gains tax on those earnings.  If it was in my Roth, I'd pay nothing.   So this has me thinking that my allocation thought process is wrong, and that maybe I shouldn't be using the Roth for the dividend paying stocks but rather the potential risky growth stocks that have potential to balloon up.

Nvidia reported first-quarter earnings for its fiscal 2024 on Wednesday, with a stronger-than-expected forecast that drove shares up 26% in extended trading.

Here's how the company did versus Refinitiv consensus estimates for the quarter ended in April:

EPS: $1.09, adjusted, versus 92 cents expected
Revenue: $7.19 billion, versus $6.52 billion expected
Nvidia said it expected sales of about $11 billion, plus or minus 2%, in the current quarter, more than 50% higher than Wall Street estimates of $7.15 billion.

Prior to the after-hours move, Nvidia stock was up 109% so far in 2023, mostly driven by optimism stemming from the company's leading position in the market for artificial intelligence chips. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company was seeing ""surging demand"" for its data center products.

Nvidia's data center group reported $4.28 billion in sales, versus expectations of $3.9 billion, a 14% annual increase. Nvidia said that performance was driven by demand for its GPU chips from cloud vendors as well as large consumer internet companies, which use Nvidia chips to train and deploy generative AI applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Nvidia's strong performance in data center shows that AI chips are becoming increasingly important for cloud providers and other companies that run large numbers of servers.

However, Nvidia's gaming division, which includes the company's graphics cards for PC sales, reported a 38% drop in revenue to $2.24 billion in sales versus expectations of $1.98 billion. Nvidia blamed the decline on a slower macroeconomic environment as well as the ramp up of the company's latest GPUs for gaming.

Nvidia's automotive division, including chips and software to develop self-driving cars, grew 114% year over year, but remains small at under $300 million in sales for the quarter.

Net income for the quarter was $2.04 billion, or 82 cents a share, compared with $1.62 billion, or 64 cents, during the year-earlier period. Nvidia's overall sales fell 13% from $8.29 billion a year ago.

*Personal take*: I don’t even know what to say, this is simply astonishing. The AFH price puts NVDA at 20% above its previous ATH. This jump would have been insane even for 2021, let alone the tech market of 2023.

I’ve often wondered about the evolutionary reasons for these trends, e.g. what is it about our behavior that makes this strategy work? I get the data, what I don’t understand is the ultimate reasons for this behavior. I think I found a compelling explanation from a surprising source. 

The following is from “Good Reasons for Bad Feelings” by Randolph Nesse. The book’s thesis is that traits such as depression and anxiety exist because they helped our ancestors have more offspring; e.g. they are important products of evolution that served a purpose. The book makes a case that before treating the undesired feeling as a problem, interrogate why you may be feeling it. Don’t confuse a symptom with the disease. 

That said, the author uses a simple but fascinating investment model to highlight how mood influences decisions. The problem that mood tries to solve is Charnov’s [Marginal Return Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_value_theorem) on diminishing returns - e.g. how many berries should you pick from a bush before moving to the next one? A conservative individual could focus on getting all the berries from one bush, but the more you pick the less remain and your rate goes down. A giddy forager might jump from bush to bush, leaving many behind but picking more per hour than their conservative peer. “Mood” in this case is fundamentally about energy allocation, and is an evolutionary shortcut based on what behaviors led to more fitness most often. 

Investing can be thought of as a bush where the number of berries shrinks and grows as opposed to remaining static - it stands to reason that the moody shortcuts to thinking that benefited our ancestors for predictable resource declines backfire spectacularly when the resource is more dynamic. 

From the book:

Take out the thyroid gland, and the resulting hypothyroidism reveals what thyroid hormone is good for. But there is no way to excise mood. Research on people who do not experience much emotion (alexithymia) is relevant, but it is unclear if people with alexithymia really lack emotional responses or if they suppress awareness of emotions.
&gt; I created a simple computer model to see if a tendency to variable mood would be a better strategy than just carrying on without mood variations. It opened my eyes to things I had not imagined. The model is a game in which three different strategies compete by making different amounts of investment on each of 100 moves. Each starts with 100 resource units.
&gt; The “Moodless” strategy invests 10 units each time. The “Moderate” strategy invests 10 percent of its resources on each turn. The “Moody” strategy invests 15 percent of its resources if the previous move gave a payoff and 5 percent if it gave a loss. The payoff for each move is based on a combination of a random number and the payoff on the previous move, so there is some predictability. The average payoff is 1 percent, but on any move the entire investment could be lost or as much as doubled.
&gt; It is great fun watching the game run. One click sets off 100 moves, and four lines crawl across the computer screen, one for each of the three strategies and one to indicate the payoffs at each move. Every run of the game turns out different thanks to tiny variations in the random factors.

[Model Results are here](https://imgur.com/a/wAObNld).

&gt; What strategy wins? It depends on the environment. Usually all three strategies come out about the same. When payoffs are moderately predictable, Moody tends to win because it takes advantage of good times and avoids risk in bad times. As payoffs become less predictable, however, the Moody strategy does worse and worse because it often risks a lot and loses a lot.
&gt; Other outcomes were unexpected, just what you hope for from a computer model. The illustration shows the results of running the game four times with identical formulas and starting values. Like the famous hypothetical example of a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil setting off a hurricane in Florida,79 slight variations in the random numbers result in wildly different outcomes. Usually all three strategies give similar results. Sometimes no strategy does very well. When there is a big winner or loser, however, it is usually Moody.
&gt; The results from this simple model may help to explain why mood regulation mechanisms vary so much from individual to individual. Minor environmental perturbations can result in drastically different payoffs for different mood regulation mechanisms, even when everything else stays the same. No one system reliably wins; much depends on chance.
&gt; When he was a graduate student in my laboratory, Eric Jackson took this much further. He programmed a computer to do 10,000 runs of the game to find out how much mood variability is best. His main conclusion is simple: when rewards vary widely and are somewhat predictable, the optimal strategy is to vary your investments substantially depending on recent payoffs—that is, use the Moody strategy. When rewards are unpredictable, however, more stable strategies win and the Moody strategy goes extinct quickly.

Tl;dr: The evolutionary environment for mood-based decision making arises from a predictably declining resource in nature. Investing is a dynamically changing resource, thus the mood-based heuristics carefully developed over the course of human evolution backfire. Arbitrary investing strategies work because they avoid this trap, provided markets increase over time."|0.92|140.0|0.0|140.0
t3_13qo5vm|1684940569.0|investing|Is the IT industry experiencing a growth spurt, or is this a bubble?|"Bernard Arnault, the head of LVMH, may be the wealthiest individual in the world, but IT companies still hold the title of the most valuable. Even following the recent market adjustment, **Apple** boasts a valuation exceeding $2.6 trillion, with **Microsoft** at $2.34 trillion, and **Alphabet** at $1.56 trillion.

How can this be? **Don't large tech firms also face the threat of economic downturns?**

Indeed, they do. However, the members of the MAMAA conglomerate (Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet) took proactive measures to prepare for a potential economic slowdown by decreasing spending, which included a **reduction in labor costs**...

The recent **turbulence in the U.S. banking sector** has further funneled funds into the tech industry. Investors have shown a preference for companies boasting substantial profit margins and large cash reserves over more traditional safe-haven assets.

Another factor driving growth has been the **surge in Artificial Intelligence**. Investors anticipate that the capital injected into this sector will yield increased sales and, subsequently, elevated profits. Microsoft, for instance, anticipates a 6.7 percent revenue increase in the current quarter due to the rising demand for AI solutions.

Heading into 2023, the IT sector strikes a somewhat subdued chord: the Nasdaq Index suffered a decline of almost 33% in 2022. However, with **decreasing inflation** and the **prospect of a pause in Fed rate hikes**, tech stocks have regained their allure.

One also should not forget to note that key support propping up Nasdaq members was **stock buybacks**. Recall, too, that both Alphabet and Apple recently announced buybacks amounting to $70 billion and $90 billion respectively. Additionally, Meta, formerly Facebook, announced a stock buyback of $40 billion.

What lies on the horizon? **What are the analysts' predictions?**

Michael Landsberg, Chief Investment Officer at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management, asserts that [large tech stocks are currently overvalued](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/megacap-tech-stocks-out-of-control-big-tech-still-has-the-power-to-extend-the-rally-and-weather-an-economic-storm-analysts-say-a60b6bc3). For example, Microsoft shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 34.3, while Amazon's PE ratio (TTM) stands at 273.79.

On the other hand, analysts at Bank of America [do not foresee any reason for alarm](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worries-over-big-tech-driving-135954915.html), and they predict that the flourishing market will persist.

So **what should we anticipate next?** If the Fed deviates from its hawkish stance, the rally could possibly extend. If not, the recent market correction may appear minor in comparison to what could transpire. Additionally, the approaching debt ceiling deadline could provoke another stock market adjustment, as new Treasury debt issuance could drain Fed reserves and curtail liquidity."|0.51|1.0|0.0|1.0

t3_13qaumj|1684902138.0|investing|Who will buy the $1 trillion of new bills flooding the market before the end of August?|"**A debt-ceiling deal will spark a new worry: Who will buy the deluge of Treasury bills?**

When the U.S. debt-ceiling fight finally is resolved, the Treasury is expected to unleash a flood of bill issuance to help refill its coffers run low by the protracted standoff in Washington, D.C., over the government’s borrowing limit.

The question is, who will buy them and at what price?

Treasury bills are debt issued by the U.S. government that mature in four to 52 weeks. New bill issuance could reach about $1.4 trillion through the end of 2023, with roughly $1 trillion flooding the market before the end of August, according to an estimate from BofA Global strategists.

They expect the deluge through August to be about five times the supply of an average three-month stretch in years before the pandemic.

“The good news is that we have a high degree of confidence around who is going to buy it,” said Mark Cabana, rates strategist at BofA Global, in a phone interview with MarketWatch. “The bad news is that it’s not going to be at current levels. Things have to cheapen.”

Cabana sees a key buyer of bill supply unleashed by a debt-ceiling deal in money-market funds, which have climbed to nearly $5.4 trillion in assets managed since the regional banking crisis erupted in March (see chart).

So people who yanked billions of dollars in deposits from banks after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March and parked them in money-market funds could end up playing an encore performance in this year’s debt-ceiling drama.

&amp;#x200B;

**$2 trillion at Fed repo facility**

Money-market funds have been the main reason why at least $2 trillion consistently sits overnight at the Federal Reserve’s reverse repo facility. The program was last offering a roughly 5% rate, a level Cabana said new Treasury bills might need to exceed by about 10-20 basis points.

&amp;#x200B;

“It’s an unintended consequence of a debt-ceiling deal getting done,” said George Catrambone, head of fixed income Americas at DWS Group, about market expectations for heavy short-term Treasury bill issuance, but he also expects money-market funds, foreign buyers and other institutions auctions to continue as buyers in the market.

MarketWatch on Multiple devices

“There’s always buyers. It’s a question of price.”

President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. met Monday to talk about potential ways to raise the $31.4 trillion borrowing limit and to avoid a “doomsday” scenario in financial markets if the U.S. defaults.Congress has struck deals each time U.S. public debt has exceeded its debt ceiling in the past, including by suspending it eight times since 2016.

&amp;#x200B;

That doesn’t mean financial markets sit by idly. The 1-month Treasury yield TMUBMUSD01M, 5.516% rose to almost 5.6% on Tuesday, while the 3-month yield TMUBMUSD03M, 5.287% was 5.3%, according to FactSet. Bill maturing around the “X-date,” which could come as soon as June 1, have even higher yields.Read: Debt-ceiling angst sends Treasury bill yields toward 6%

&amp;#x200B;

“Those are obviously pretty heady yields,” Catrambone said. “But it also exemplifies the market having to price in potential market disruptions in the month of June,” even though his team, like many in financial markets, expect that eventually “cooler heads will prevail” in Washington as the debt-ceiling standoff heads down to the wire.

&amp;#x200B;

**How the money ran out**

The Treasury in January hit its borrowing limit and began operating under “extraordinary measures” to avoid a default.

Cash balances at the Treasury Department have since dwindled to less than $100 billion, according to economists at Jefferies. Barclays strategists estimate its cash balance may fall below $50 billion between June 5-15.

“Basically, we are just draining our cash account to fund operations while we wait to figure out the debt ceiling,” said Lindsay Rosner, senior portfolio manager at PGIM Fixed Income.

But when the battle over the debt limit ends in a resolution, she expects longer-dated Treasury yields to increase, as haven buying on fears of potentially a full U.S. government default and a credit rating downgrade will have been taken off the table.

“The Armageddon, whatever small probability people were pricing in of catastrophe, remove that,” she said. “And that means the worst economic outcome has been removed.”

That’s also a reason why Rosner has been avoiding ultrashort Treasurys in the eye of the debt-ceiling fight in favor of 2, 3 or 4-year bonds offering some of the highest yields in years.

“We’re being afforded good yield, good spread, a couple of years out the curve,” she said. “Play that game.”

From my limited understanding stable value is meant to be similar to a MMF giving the investor capital preservation as top priority. If you were a wizard that could time the market, I’d assume this would be a place to park funds before a crash. 

That being said, I’m also reading that a government Default may have implications on money market funds as well as equities. Is this accurate?

For instance, if there is a government default and my money, be it a 401K, IRA, or even credit Union, is in a stable value fund (like Morley) or money-market fund, could that see a devaluation as strong, or stronger, than would be felt in the equities market?

I am subject to a trading window that happens to be within 30 days oof the vest dates so any sales I do in this account are always considered wash sales, since I can only transact so close to the vest date.  


I currently have a few lots some with losses and some with gains (these are all same stock) and wanted to sell some of them to diversify. I am worried about not being able to offset taxes with the lots that have losses because of wash sale.  


From what I understand if I sell the lots that have the loss because it is a wash sale the loss will instead by added as cost basis for future transactions. However I will not ever do a buy transaction in this account so there won't be much to add the cost basis too.   


Here are some options I came up with depending on the interpretation of the tax setup:  


1. Assuming the cost basis will also be adjusted for subsequent sell. I would sell the loss stocks, get the disallowed loss. The next day I would sell the other lot that has gains and hopefully Schwab figures it out and adjust the cost basis for that sale. This is logical to be but I see no confirmation it actually works this way.
2. I see only the loss stocks and get the disallowed loss. On the next RSU vest Schwab will adjust the cost basis of new shares (technically it is a buy) with the loss. Also not sure it works with RSU vests.
3. I should only sell the stocks that have gains to avoid wasting losses, and only sell the loss stocks after I leave the company. This sounds like a really bad option."|0.61|6.0|0.0|6.0

This is a ways out, but it bears consideration.  

I'm curious if you have any ideas what you might be able to use a Longterm Care for if it needs to stop functioning as an LTC. I think a small retrofit would work for a minimum security prison, pretty posh student accommodations, or psychiatric hospital. Presently they value their property and equipment at the greater of the projected net proceeds of sale or its value in use, and while the auditors have employed real estate consultants to assess the value of the net proceeds of sale, I wouldn't mind ideas about what alternatives uses they might have that could impact the sale price.  

It's funny, but while people have talked a lot about a demographic boom in LTC demand, eventually that demand will fall again and then we're going to be left with excess properties that have been customized to LTC use. Maybe my idea of funny is a bit off here, though. Also, prudential management will allow the properties to degrade significantly on the tail end of that demand trajectory, which would further impact the value of said properties.

(As an aside, I don't want to say demand curve here because I'm looking at it as a stock chart over time not a demand per price or something... what's the correct term for what I'm looking for? I chose trajectory for clarity but if there's a proper term I would love to hear it.)"|0.45|0.0|0.0|0.0

However, I thought his CANSLIM system made a certain amount of sense, and sounded like a reasonable set of rules for some play money investing (my primary investment is long term index tracking).

I did finally relent and take the bait, and recently signed up for the IBD Digital trial. I'm actually quite impressed by the content and analysis, but one thing struck me as a little concerning. It has a section called the ""IBD 50"", described as ""IBD's flagship screen of leading growth stocks gives you 50 companies showing strong relative price strength and top-notch fundamentals"". Basically the top 50 stocks most conforming with the CANSLIM system at that moment in time, and I presume updated daily.

I also saw that there is an ETF to track the IBD 50, Innovator Capital Management's IBD 50 ETF (FFTY). So I was a little surprised to see how poorly it's performed... 1 Year -20%, 3 year -8%, 5 year -7.48% ([https://www.etf.com/etfanalytics/etf-comparison/VOO-vs-FFTY](https://www.etf.com/etfanalytics/etf-comparison/VOO-vs-FFTY)).

Does that blow the CANSLIM system out of the water, or is this a poor way to judge the effectiveness of the system?

I know the CANSLIM system is heavily reliant on entering and exiting a position at the right time, attempting to capitalise on explosive growth, so maybe an ETF tracking the stocks that simply conform to the IBD ""checklist"" doesn't take this into account, holding the stocks well beyond their CANSLIM sell point. Still, I'm finding it worrying that a group of 50 stocks that apparently are absolute best in class could perform so poorly as an ETF."|0.73|5.0|0.0|5.0

I am very much into managing and being on top of my finances, but I am far from a savvy investor.  After playing around with stocks where I just buy companies I know and like, and rely on analysts input I am moving away from that as it has not worked out well.

Currently, I have a Betterment account with a 70% stock 30% bond portfolio and I created an etrade 3 fund portfolio based on vanguard etf's.

Pro's for etrade is I can see real time updates.  I am not tinkering or playing as I know you need to leave it but I like seeing how I am doing.  I also get more control and no fees.  Con's are I have to stay on top of rebalancing, and I cannot buy fractional shares without the automatic investment on which means I cannot rebalance through deposits.

for Betterment it is obviously set it and forget it.  On top of the rebalancing I know they say they do tax harvesting.  It is certainly a bit more boring lol, but I am sure works.  Biggest downside is the updated balance doesnt post until next day which again for a set and forget it is fine but I like seeing it.  And they charge a 0.25 % fee.

&amp;#x200B;

Question is....  Does the tax harvesting and rebalancing pay off the 0.25% fee or is it more cost efficient to manage myself (which means I wont do tax harvesting as I wouldnt know how to myself).  I enjoy being more in control of my fund, but at the same time I am in a very high tax bracket as a business owner even though my investment balance is very low (5k in each account roughly)"|0.71|18.0|0.0|18.0

* After doing some research on early-stage private investing I feel most capital gains happen in that space, as it's a high-risk high reward game.  I looked into getting into that space through Forge marketplace, but you need to be an accredited investor (min net worth of 1 million USD, or 300k annual salary) which I believe is such a high barrier of entry and as you expect I don't qualify. Curious why this criteria is put in the first place by SEC? Is it to make private investing accessible only for rich people, not surprised though as we live in a capitalistic environment. Is there any legal loophole around this criteria. The frustrating part is I have the capital and I have 5-7 private companies to invest in my watchlist, but I am not allowed to invest.


* I have invested in some private companies through crowd investing portal like Wefunder, but not all the promising companies come on such platform to raise funding. 


* Is it better to create a venture fund by yourself by pooling with others, but I am totally new to this.

- Amundi, Europe's largest asset manager, is moving out of US assets in favor of China.
- The move is motivated by China's brighter economic prospects, better valuations, and a more benign outlook for inflation.
- Vincent Mortier, chief investment officer of Amundi, believes that too much risk is priced into Chinese credit and high-quality companies, while markets in the US are ""too optimistic"" as a recession looms.
- Mortier predicts that the US economy will not grow next year, while China, India, and Indonesia will each grow by 5 to 6 percent.
- Despite recent political tensions and disappointing economic data, Amundi is optimistic about China and has been gradually increasing its allocation to China and India over the past 12 months.
- Mortier is particularly keen on opportunities in select Chinese corporate bonds, arguing that foreign investors have been blanket selling without differentiating between the quality of issuers.
- US markets are pricing in a ""goldilocks"" scenario of low inflation, rate cuts, stronger earnings, and a soft landing, which Mortier thinks is becoming increasingly remote as financial conditions tighten.
- Mortier thinks inflation in both the US and Europe will stabilize at around 3 to 4 percent in the years ahead, with some volatility that will make the Fed's job particularly difficult.
- However, Mortier is not worried about the possibility of a US debt default."|0.79|130.0|0.0|130.0

I'm reaching out to make sure I'm on the right track, and that I have some decent reasoning behind my selections considering I don't have much experience investing at all.

I started the account when she was 3, she's now 4.5, so this account should go to her in about 13.5 years.  I've tried to select mostly mutual funds since these come with a number of individual stocks, so essentially a pre-built diversified portfolio.  I have selected the following mutual funds:

FSMEX: There's always medical advances and research, medical seems like it should grow over time.  Therefore, I am currently down on this one by 20%

FSPTX: Technology continues to develop, this should be fairly safe.  Artificial Intelligence and quantum computing are here and will likely change the world.  Therefore, I am down 10%.

FSELX: It seems like Semiconductors are in everything electronic, and there are plans to bring some of that manufacturing to the United States.  This one is up 3%.

FSLEX: Environmental technology and energy is going to become more important as climate change continues.  Besides which, I want a cleaner/greener world for the kiddo, and I think it's important to invest in your values.  This one is up 5%.



Fidelity tells me this is an aggressive growth mix.  I'm interrupting this as meaning that barring any oddly catastrophic situations this portfolio should grow very well over the next 13 years.  

So far, this basic reasoning seems to make sense to me, but I'm a novice and if there is anything I'm wrong about, I'd like to know now.

Do these selections make sense?

Is there anything I should drop or add?

There's a company I'm looking at, with a market cap too small to mention here, that had yearly options chains. January expiry, and these would always be released **exactly** 28 months prior. This was consistent for years.

The company I'm referencing has a 2024 January expiry. It was released 'on schedule' (i.e. same as every other year)

Example: like does Amazon, $AMZN, have a software that’s given to them from the NASDAQ that shows their stock price chart, volume, EMA, maybe some more things for them to see chart related. Then they can see their constantly changing market cap and P/E ratio. They can see documents filed by the company, investor’s filings, articles from authors including themselves listed on there. Do they see banks and or the Fed pushing them loans, interest rates, and terms on a table chart that they can choose from? Or is it just companies call up a bank they want and talk to them about a loan? I know people fund their market cap but the company can’t just go and sell their shares constantly, so they keep their shares and give them to their employees, and also buy them back. Then they can push up cash/ shares to borrow against and get back those shares once they pay off the loan or do their shares not ever go to the bank and are held? The ladder? Do they have their live account balances in terms of their cash and asset holdings debt to these banks?

The more the market cap and the higher P/E ratio the more the people believe in the company and want to fund them. So, the company has access to more cash, can get better rates and terms from banks pushing them loans to choose from.

I also do understand the semiconductor industry is extremely cyclical (especially for GPU producers). This can lead to these metrics becoming misleading in some scenarios but in this case they are still concerning. At this valuation even if NVDA 5x FCF they would trade at 52 times FCF.

t3_13l5gc0|1684431597.0|investing|[D] The Question facing Nvidia|"The problem this stock faces is no one knows how to value it.

The company are investing in technology that opens up new markets (AI, Omniverse and self driving for example).  Will those markets pan out or will they go bust?  And if they do pan out, what's the value of those markets?    Nobody knows, these markets haven't been served before.

Today's share price is a reflection of the market sentiment, the voting machine's results as of this moment.   The current share price is either grossly over extended or grossly undervalued -- there is no in between in my opinion.

I believe Nvidia has cemented itself as the hardware technology leadership company of the era, much like IBM and Intel of past decades.   Some on Wall St understand this, others are coming to understand it.  But there are many who doubt that is the case as well.

The most obvious question from doubters is about competition:  Won't AMD or Intel or Google or Apple just come in with better technology and take their position?

I've been invested in this company for more than 15 years and what they do uniquely are two things:  1.  Strategize and 2.  Execute.   They have been building a GPGPU platform (General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit), otherwise known as ""accelerated computing"" since about 2007.   It's different from standard CPUs in that it processes massive amounts of data in parallel, tens of thousands of ""cores"" operating at the same time.  Their platform is a combination of inter-generational compatible hardware and software.  The platform is robust, reliable, well supported, offers regular performance improvements, and is now ubiquitous with over 4million developers using it including nearly every AI developer on the planet.

So when a competitor comes to throw their hat in the ring, there is an enormous defensive position to overcome that includes a large user base who are getting reliable, quantifiable and predictable results.  

Since 2014 predictions of Nvidia's demise in the data center have been constant from both mammoth technology companies (AMD, Intel, Google, Baidu) and startups alike.    But no one has been able to make a real dent in Nvidia's momentum and share -- not with CPUs, ASICs, FPGAs or any other technology.  In their core area of AI model training, Nvidia has between 85-95% market share depending on whose numbers you look at.   They are serving this with the largest, most complex mass produced semiconductor devices man can imagine.

What about other GPUs?   GPUs have proven an excellent solution for the job, they are readily available, flexible and performant.  AMD and Intel are building new GPUs and pursuing as "" AI is their number 1 priority.""  I expect these companies to pick up some business simply because Nvidia cannot service 100% of the demand they are creating.  But these well-regarded companies have a difficult hill to climb in software.  They need to make their products work as well as Nvidia's to be competitive, if they don't they will likely sell at a deep discount.

A ""real"" competitive offering will have to exceed Nvidia's solution in both performance and ease of use.   I haven't seen that sort of competitor surface in the past 10 years, nor can I see one on the horizon.  There may be one lurking -- certainly a possibility -- but it will take 2-4 years minimum for that type of solution to come to market.   In the mean time, Nvidia is out re-architecting data centers with AI-centric chip solutions:  CPUs, GPUs, DPUs and networking and switching technology.  They continue to raise the bar for competitors.  Soon data center processing will be managed by AI techniques to yield better, faster, more power efficient results sooner.   

Nvidia owns data center acceleration -- the nexus of AI -- for the near term.  Is AI a real technology that has launched and will add value to human kind in innumerable ways, or does it sputter and fizzle into another ""AI winter"" from whence Nvidia becomes a footnote in history?   That is the question on this company's share price.  FPE, PS, DCF ?  These are just irrelevant metrics in this context."|0.85|91.0|0.0|91.0

t3_13l4l6b|1684429499.0|investing|Gold has broken out of its corridor|"For nearly two months, it traded within the range of **$1975-2050**. Support at its lower boundary held off a price decline in the latter half of April, but it couldn't hold up this time.

Prices have dipped below that range, now breaching the 50-day average.

The reasons are apparent. Optimism about the debt ceiling, plus upward movement in the dollar and other risk assets can only mean one thing: a corresponding downturn for gold.

**So where might the drop stop?**

This morning, Lorie K. Logan gave an additional boost to the dollar, adding to the uncertainty about just how far gold could fall. The next halt could be at $1950, where the price would meet the ascending trendline from November. By early June, the 100-day average will likely reach the same point. At that poing, you could speculatively buy a bit of **GLD** or **JNUG**.

But be cautious with the volume, as a breach of the trend could quickly drive prices down to $1900 or even lower. If that happens, it would be a good opportunity to buy more substantively, as **I see gold substantially above $2000 in the long term**.

If gold quickly returns to its range, it will likely rebound to $2010-2020. But as always, further movements will depend on the developing situation.

Even if there's no immediate need to hedge against a default, inflation risks remain. Having some gold still won't hurt."|0.41|0.0|0.0|0.0

Role has a pension, but requires 10 years to be vested. At current salary it would pay out 33k after 30 years on 55k salary, and 45k if I hypothetically got a raise to 75k.

The 90k role I would be learning more, as I'm stagnating more. This role is also remote. However, I would have a higher workload, and maybe less work/life balance. The University role is almost abnormally slow at times though and I'll only have around 3 tickets a week.

PTO: University I get 13 holidays, and 10 hours vacation added every month, Company 7 holidays, and 6 hours vacation added every month

I'm also currently renting for 1500, have to spend money for gas. With the 90k role being remote, I could move back in with family and save a little bit more money. However, the money doesn't matter if they were to let me go after a few months.

Some, have told me with the higher salary I could invest a lot more even though the other job has a pension. But, others have tole me with the public sector role I could never out live retirement, and with the private sector role I'd have to put away more of my own money for retirement.

That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees.

UPDATE TO CLARIFY:

My biggest concern wouldn't be losing my principle, I don't think that would happen. But with all of the current high rates, having a large chunk of money tied up in an investment that wouldn't end up being fruitful in the end, would be a huge **opportunity cost**.  
  
For example, If I invest $100k today in a FDIC protected CD whose bank ends up going under, yes I would get my principle money back , but maybe not the interest, and that could be a huge opportunity cost with all of the other great rates around. Losing out on returns is my biggest concern, not losing my principle. I want to put my money to as good use as possible (ie, gain as much interest as possible) with as little possibility of losing that interest.

Has a downside protection of 10% should it be within -10% loss in 6 years i would still get the principal back in full (not sure if with the participation bonus?).  Lower than that would incur losses with the market.

It sounds good and a pretty safe place for a large portion, and a long enough term that I expect the market to not be lower at that point.  Unfortunately its locked away for 6 years.

If people increasingly go into debt making purchases from the grocer just to feed themselves isn’t that a very big problem?"|0.62|3.0|0.0|3.0

Capcom had its best financial year ever by selling more games than any other previous year in its history. This was the sixth consecutive year in which the company managed to sell even more games than before, thanks to a few big hitters and a huge catalog with many excellent remakes of famous Capcom franchises.

The Japanese game developer and publisher had a great financial year in 2022, despite not releasing many titles. The company’s fiscal year, which started in April 2022 and ended in March 2023, saw the release of the Resident Evil 4 remake, which got excellent reviews, and Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, an expansion DLC for the original game.

Capcom recently revealed, via its financial reports for 2022, that it sold 41.7 million games in its fiscal year. As originally spotted by VGC, the company was able to beat its own records for the sixth year in a row, growing from the 32.6 games sold in the previous year. The sales were led by two games released within the year: Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, which managed to sell 5.45 million units, and Resident Evil 4, which was only out for a few days before the fiscal year ended but still sold an amazing number of 3.75 million units. According to Capcom, most of the sales came from other, older games, including the original Monster Hunter Rise (3.7 million units), Resident Evil 2 (2.25 million), and Resident Evil 3 (1.95 million).

The good financial results also impacted Capcom’s shares, which are being sold at 5,270 Japanese Yen (JPY) at the time of this report. As a comparison, they were at around 3,300 JPY a year ago, and 1,300 JPY five years ago, showing just how meteoric the company’s financial rise has been. It’s definitely a far cry from the time when the company released Resident Evil 6, for instance, often considered one of the worst entries in the Resident Evil franchise.

Players may be wondering how Capcom intends to top its own records in the future. The answer, it seems, could be on rebooting the Dead Rising franchise. According to recent rumors, the Japanese game developer may be working on bringing back the series. However, this was not confirmed officially so far. Obviously, Resident Evil 4 was also released at the end of the fiscal year and it was a huge hit, so it will probably appear as one of the top-sellers, too, and Street Fighter 6 is just around the corner, promising even more sales."|0.5|0.0|0.0|0.0
t3_13k6drk|1684340305.0|investing|Bank CD interests vs Stock Market|"If banks are offering higher CD interest rates to consumers, I assume banks use the funds they receive from consumers to either lend out to other consumers as loans with higher interest rates or use the funds to invest in the stock market in hopes of higher returns than the CD interest rate they are paying out. Also assuming the higher CD interest rate is because of the higher fed fund rate. 

Not being too educated in this subject, should I assume if the banks are willing to give out higher CD interest rates than normal, does that mean we can expect the stock market to trend upwards where in general we could receive higher yields than the CD rates offered by the bank as a sign? 

Assuming and knowing that the stock market is much more volatile than a CD where it's backed up to a certain amount by the government etc. 

But in the general sense, can we assume a bullish stock market if banks are incentivizing consumers to deposit money through them by advertising highish CD interest rates?

In the context of time using now, CD interest rates seems to be climbing slowly upwards and seems to be near the highs in the last 20-30 years. I just hear we are not bottomed out yet in the recession but just couldn't make sense why banks would offer higher CD interest rates if they didn't see an opportunity to reinvest those funds for potential higher yields in other markets, specifically the stock market. I'm sure some would go towards giving out loans for higher interests to consumers but I assume definitely not all. Just trying to understand the overall logic.

If you could kindly explain in the sense that I don't have too much knowledge in this field, that would help me understand your answers better."|0.53|1.0|0.0|1.0

* The forecast for the platinum deficit in 2023 has been revised upward by 77% to 983 koz, with demand increasing by 28% and supply decreasing by 1% year-on-year. 
* Stronger-than-anticipated positive investment demand in the first quarter has led to an increased full-year forecast of 433 koz. 
* Industrial demand is projected to hit a record high, increasing 17% as a result of glass production expansions in China. 
* Strong platinum demand growth in the automotive sector is set to continue in 2023, with a projected rise of 12%.

**What's noteworthy?**

WPIC believes that an economic slowdown will not hinder new record highs in industrial demand. As usual, China is expected to be of a major contributing factor thanks to a rise in its demand for chemicals and demand and expansions in LCD glass capacity.

The equally strong demand for platinum in the automotive sector is partly based on increased vehicle production, but is primarily the result of the increased amount of platinum per vehicle produced. HDV production in China is estimated to jump 26%, while stricter emissions legislation will result in higher loadings.

WPIC's estimates are undoubtedly realistic. However, a lot could go wrong. If reality turns out to be slightly less rosy, we can forget about a surge in investment demand.

This is precisely what happened in 2022. A year ago, WPIC was expecting a +104 koz increase for 2022. The final result was -640 koz. Since investment demand is the most volatile, it often has the most significant impact on prices.

It was the outflow of funds from platinum ETFs that caused the price to slump below $850 last summer.

However, even if history repeats itself this year, the dip won't be long-lasting. Unlike palladium, which is almost 90% dependent on automotive demand, platinum demand is more diversified, and its role in green energy will provide long-term support.

t3_13i3cne|1684143415.0|investing|Let us brew bucks with precision fermentation... but how?|"Are you hungry too? I am, as always.

I want to discuss a topic that has been increasingly getting attention in the food tech sector – **precision fermentation**.

In its essence, precision fermentation is a technology that brews food in large fermentation chambers. It's not a new concept – if you appreciate a good brew, you might already be familiar with it. This technology can create a variety of foods, from dairy and honey to meat alternatives, which is what's making it increasingly significant.

My excitement comes from the potential of this technology to produce high-quality, cost-effective proteins that could be superior to their animal-based equivalents. The ultimate goal is to reduce our dependency on animals as a primary food source.

Considering the predictions that our food production must double by 2050 to cater to nearly 10 billion people, traditional methods might not suffice. That's where precision fermentation steps in. RethinkX, an independent think tank, suggests that U.S. beef and dairy production might decline by more than 50% by 2030 and nearly 90% by 2035. However, they expect alternatives created by precision fermentation to cost between 50% and 80% less than the animal products they replace.

Moreover, precision fermentation might also bring numerous environmental benefits by using less land, feedstock, and water resources.

Investors have caught onto the potential. Companies in this sector raised $911 million in venture capital in just the first quarter of this year, with fermentation companies pulling in $290 million of that. Since 2010, fermentation-derived meat, seafood, egg, and dairy companies have raised over $3 billion.

The precision fermentation market size is projected to grow exponentially, from $1.6 billion in 2022 to an estimated $36.3 billion by 2030. So: \***22.7**. This growth will be driven by a lower carbon footprint and a surge in the production of precision-fermented ingredients.

Given all this, it's clear that precision fermentation is not just a trend – it is the future of food production. But that leaves us with the million-dollar question (quite literally, if you play your cards right):

**Does anyone know how smaller investors like ourselves can invest in these companies?**

And are there companies on the stock market that you're already following or investing in?

Let's be honest, who wouldn't want to make a bit of money while contributing to a sustainable future? It's a win-win if you ask me. (Or potentially lose a heap of money for a good cause, which, to be honest, is more my style of investing...)

So, let's hear your thoughts! How can we invest in precision fermentation and make both our wallets and our consciences a bit heavier?

Thank you for your time.

I have 75k I want to invest into betterment accounts. I am comfortable keeping most in cash reserves - thinking 55k in cash reserves, 10k in their core portfolio (plus $150 per month deposit) and 10k in their goldman beta portfolio (also with $150 per month deposit). I would appreciate any advice or thoughts about this plan."|0.67|3.0|0.0|3.0

Let’s assume the rate hikes are finished. When referring to small cap stocks I’m including value, blend, or growth so don’t be afraid to specify if you have something in mind. The current environment is not favorable for small caps as we’ve seen other areas bounce back like QQQ and the other large cap blue chips.  What else needs to happen for small cap stocks/funds/ETFs to return to favor? Am I wrong to even focus on small caps and need to direct my attention to another area like emerging markets or international?|0.78|8.0|0.0|8.0
